    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes when and how an operator uses the technique of 
	  Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) for the IPv4 residual
      deployment in the IPv6-dominant domain.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>IPv4 address exhaustion has become world-wide reality and the primary 
      solution in the industry is to deploy IPv6-only networking. Meanwhile,
      having access to legacy IPv4 contents and services is a long-term
      requirement, will be so until the completion of the IPv6 transition. It
      demands sharing residual IPv4 address pools for IPv4 communications
      across the IPv6-only domain(s).</t>

      <t>Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"></xref> is designed
      in response to the requirement of stateless residual deployment. The
      term "residual deployment" refers to utilizing not-yet-assigned or
      recalled IPv4 addresses for IPv4 communications going across the IPv6
      domain backbone. MAP assumes the IPv6-only backbone as the prerequisite
      of deployment so that native IPv6 services and applications are fully
      supported and encouraged. The statelessness of MAP ensures only moderate
      overhead is added to part of the network devices.</t>

      <t>Residual deployment with MAP is new to most operators. This document
      is motivated to provide basic understanding on the usage of MAP, i.e.,
      when and how an operator can do with MAP to meet its own operational
      requirements of IPv6 transition and its facility conditions, in the
      phase of IPv4 residual deployment. Potential readers of this document
      are those who want to know: <list style="numbers">
          <t>What are the requirements of MAP deployment ?</t>

          <t>What technical options needs to be considered when deploying MAP,
          and how?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on the address planning for both IPv6 and
          IPv4 pools?</t>

          <t>How does MAP impact on daily network operations and
          administrations?</t>

          <t>How do we migrate to IPv6-only network with the help of MAP?</t>

      <t>MAP can be deployed for large-scale carrier networks.
	  There are typically two network models for broadband access service: 
   one is to use PPPoE/PPPoA authentication method while the other is to use IPoE. 
   The first one is usually applied to Residential network and SOHO networks. 
   Subscribers in CPNs can access broadband network by PPP dial-up authentication. 
   BRAS is the key network element which takes full responsibility of IP address 
   assignment, user authentication, traffic aggregation, PPP session termination, 
   etc. Then IP traffic is forwarded to Core Routers through Metro Area Network, 
   and finally transited to Internet via Backbone network. The second network 
   scenario is usually applied to large enterprise networks. Subscribers in CPNs 
   can access broadband network by IPoE authentication. IP address is normally 
   assigned by DHCP server, or static configuration. </t>
<t>In either case, a CPE could obtain a prefix via prefix delegation procedure, 
   and the hosts behind CPE would get its own IPv6 addresses within the prefix 
   through SLAAC or DHCPv6 statefully. A MAP CE would also obtain a set of MAP 
   rules from DHCPv6 server.  </t>

   communication for broadband access services. </t>

      <section title="Building the MAP domain">
      	
	<t>When deploying stateless MAP in operational network, a provider 
	should firstly do MAP domain planning based on its own network 
	condition. According to the definition of  
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"></xref>, a MAP domain is a 
	set of MAP CEs and BRs connected to the same virtual link. One MAP 
	domain shares a common BR and has the same set of BMRs, FMRs and DMR, 
	and it can be further divided into multiple sub-domains when multiple 
	IPv4 subnets are deployed in one MAP domain. All CEs in the MAP domain

        <section title="MAP DHCPv6 server deployment consideration">
         <t>All the CEs within a MAP domain will get the same set of MAP 
         rules by DHCPv6 server, including BMR, FMRs and DMR. In one MAP 
         domain, BMR for different CEs might be different, but FMRs and DMR 
         are all the same. Each Mapping Rule keeps a record of Rule IPv6 
         prefix, Rule IPv4 prefix, Rule EA-bits length and Rule Port 
         Parameters. Section 5 would give a step by step example of how to 
         calculate these parameters. </t>
	<t>As the MAP is stateless, the deployment of DHCPv6 server is 
	independent of MAP domain planning. So there are three possible cases:
	</t>
	<t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:1">This is the ideal 
	  solution that each MAP domain would have its own MAP DHCPv6 server. 
	  In this case, MAP DHCPv6 server only needs to configure parameters

	  <t hangText="MAP domain : DHCPv6 server = 1:N">This might happen

	  distributed manner. In this case, all these DHCPv6 servers should

	  domains. </t>
	</list></t>
	
	<t>Besides, the situation of remaining IPv4 address prefixes may have 
	big impact on MAP rule planning, especially for service operators who 
	only have rather scattered address space. Since the number of 
	scattered IPv4 address prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR 
	rules within a MAP domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address 
	pool as possible to reduce the number of FMR rules.</t>

        <section title="PSID consideration">
          <t>For PSID provisioning, all the CEs, BR and DHCPv6 server within 
          the same MAP domain should be configured with the same parameter 
          value. All CEs with the same BMR should have the same PSID length. 
          If a provider would like to introduce differentiated address sharing 
          ratios for different CEs, it is better to define multiple MAP 
          sub-domains with different Rule IPv4 prefixes. In this way, MAP 
          domain division is only a logical method, rather than a geographical 
          one.</t> 
	  <t> The default PSID offset is chosen as 4 in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map"></xref> and full-zero PSID is 
	  not permitted to use, which excludes the use of port range 0~4096. 
	  Operator may adjust the value based on actual usage, policy, and 
	  service model.</t>
	  <t>With regard to PSID format, both continuous and non-continuous 
	  port set can be supported in GMA algorithm. Non-continuous port 
	  set has the advantage of better security, UPnP friendly, etc., 
	  while continuous port set is the simplest way to implement. Since 
	  PSID format should be supported not only in CPEs, BRs and DHCPv6 
	  server, but also in other sustaining systems as well, e.g. traffic 
	  logging system, user management system, a provider should make the 
	  decision based on a comprehensive investigation on its demand and 
	  the reality of existing equipments. </t>
	  <t>Note that some ISPs may need to offer services in a MAP domain 
	  with a shared address, e.g. there are hosts FTP server under CEs.  
	  The service provisioning may require well-know port range (i.e. 
	  port range belong to 0-1023). MAP would provide operators with an 
	  option to generate a port range including those in 0-1023.  
	  Afterwards, operators could decide to assign it to any requesting 
	  user. However, if the port-set is too small, it is not suggested 
	  to assign one with only the port set 0~1023 or even less. 
	  Considerable non-well-known ports are surely needed. Another easier 
	  approach is assigning a dedicated IPv4 address to such a CE if the 
	  demand really exists.

        <section title="Addressing and routing">
          <t> In MAP addressing, it should follow the MAP rule planning in 
          the MAP domain. </t>
	  <t> For IPv4 addressing, since the number of scattered IPv4 address 
	  prefixes would be equal to the number of FMR rules within a MAP 
	  domain, one should choose as large IPv4 address pool as possible 
	  to reduce the number of FMR rules.For IPv6 address, the Rule IPv6 
	  prefixes should be equal to the end user IPv6 prefix in MAP domain. 
	  </t>
	  <t>If ISP has a /24 rule IPv4 prefix with sharing ratio of 64 gives 
	  16000 customers, and a /16 rule IPv4 prefix supports 4 million 
	  customer. If up the sharing ratio to 256, 64000 and 16 million 
	  customers can be supports respectively. For the ISP who have number 
	  of scattered IPv4 address prefixes, in order to reduce the FMRs, 
	  according to needs of ports they can divide different class. For 
	  instance, for the enterprise customers class which need many 
	  ports to use, provision them the BMR with low sharing ratio while 
	  for the private customers class which don't need so many ports 
	  provision them the BMR with high sharing ratio.</t>

        </section>
        

        <section title="MAP vs. MAP-T vs. 4rd">
	  <t>Basically, encapsulation provides an architectural building block 
	  of virtual link where the underlay behavior is fully hidden, while 
	  translation does a delivery participating into the end-to-end 
	  transferring path where behaviors are exposed. It is reflected in 
	  the following aspects. </t>

	  <t>1. Option header</t>
	  <t>There may be some options in the IPv4 header, and some of them 
	  may not be able to mapped to IPv6 option headers accurately 
	  [RFC791][RFC2460]. If translation or 4rd ``reversible translation''
	  is applied, those options can not be supported, and packets with 
	  those options SHOULD be dropped. Encapsulation does not have this 
	  problem. </t>

	  <t>2. ICMP</t> 
	  <t>Some IPv4 ICMP codes do not have a corresponding codes in ICMPv6, 
	  a detailed analysis on the double translation behavior suggest that 
	  some ICMPv4 messages, when they are translated to ICMPv6 and back to 
	  ICMPv4 across the IPv6 domain, the accuracy might be sacrificed to 
	  some extent. Encapsulation keeps the full transparency of ICMPv4 
	  messages. </t>
	  <t>Reversible translation approach of 4rd, however, does not 
	  translate ICMPv4 messages into ICMPv6 version. Instead, it treats 
	  ICMP as same as a transport layer protocol data unit. This behavior 
	  is similar to the encapsulation and keeps ICMP end-to-end 
	  transparency as well. </t>
	  <t>Only MAP-T translator is compatible with single translation 
	  approach, while the 4rd translator must be used in pair between a 
	  peer of ends in communication. </t> 

  	  <t>In either the encapsulation or translation mode, if an 
  	  intermediate node generates an ICMPv6 error message, it should be 
  	  converted into ICMPv4 version and returned to the source with a 
  	  special source address and following the bevior specified in  
  	  <xref target="RFC6791"></xref>. However, the behavior and semantics 
  	  of the translation from ICMPv6 to ICMPv4 is different among 
  	  encapsulation, translation and 4rd reversible translation 
  	  approaches. Encapsulation treats routing error in the IPv6 domain 
  	  as an (virtual)link error between the tunnel end points, while 
  	  translation translate IPv6 routing error into corresponding IPv4 
  	  version, and 4rd, however, behaves according to whether the Tunnel 
  	  Traffic Class option is set. The TTL behavior also reflect the 
  	  differences among different approaches, which is worth paying 
  	  attention to for the operating engineers. </t>

	  <t>3. PMTU and fragmentation</t> 
	  <t>Both translation mode and encapsulation mode have PMTU and 
	  fragmentation problem. <xref target="RFC6145"></xref> discusses 
	  the problem in details for the translation, while 
	  <xref target="RFC2473"></xref> could be a reference on the 
	  issue in encapsulation. </t>

	  <t>If the fragment happens in the IPv6 stack, then only the first 
	  fragement contains full IPv4 destination address so that BR cannot 
	  to the decapsulation well until all fragments has been received. 
	  This disables the funtionality of anycast BR. To prevent this 
	  problem, MAP require the fragmentation is done in the IPv4 stack to 
	  fit the IPv6 domain path MTU. MAP-T and 4rd has not this problem as
	  every IPv6 packet contains the full IPv4 address embedded into the 
	  IPv6 address and end-point reassembly is ensured.</t>

 	  <!-- t>4. End-user IPv6 prefix restrictions</t>
	  <t>Translation mode doen't permit the End-user IPv6 prefix to 
	  exceed 64bits while encapsulation mode doesn't have that 
	  restrictions. If ISP only has long IPv6 prefixes used as Rule IPv6 
	  prefix, the end-user IPv6 prefix is possible to exceed 64bits, in 
	  this case, the translation mode may not be suitable.

      <section title="BR settings">
        <t>1. BR placement</t>

		<t>BR placement has important impacts on the operation of a MAP domain.</t>

        <t>A first concern should be the avoidance of "triangle routing". That is, the path from the CE to an IPv4 peer via the BR should be close to the one that would be taken if the CE had native IPv4 connectivity. This can be accomplished easily by placing the BR close to the CE, such that the length of the path from the CE to the BR is minimized.</t>

        <t>However, minimizing the CE-BR path would ignore a second concern, that of minimizing IPv4 operations. An ISP deploying MAP will probably want to focus on IPv6 operations, while keeping IPv4 operational expenditures to a minimum. This would imply that the size of the IPv4 network that the ISP has to administer would be kept to a minimum. Placing the BR near the CE means that the length of the IPv4 network between the BR and the IPv4 Internet would be longer.</t>
        
		<t>Moreover, in case where the set of CEs is geographically dispersed, multiple BRs would be needed, which would further enlarge the IPv4 network that the ISP has to maintain.</t>

        <t>Therefore, we offer the following guideline: BRs should be placed as close to the border with the IPv4 Internet as possible while keeping triangle routing to a minimum. Regional POPs should probably be considered as potential candidates.</t>

        <t>Note also that MAP being stateless, asymmetric routing is possible, meaning that separate BRs can be used for traffic entering and exiting a MAP domain.  This option can be considered for its effects on traffic engineering.</t>

        <t>Anycast can be used to let the network pick BR closest to a CE for traffic exiting the MAP domain. This is accomplished by provisioning a Default Mapping Rule containing an anycast IPv6 address or prefix. Operationally, this allows incremental deployment of BRs in strategic locations without modifying the provisioning system's configuration. CE's close to a newly-deployed BR will automatically start using it.</t>


        <t>2. Reliability Considerations</t>

		
        <t>Reliability of MAP is derived in major part from its statelessness. This means that MAP can benefit from the usual methods of Internet reliability.</t>

        <t>Anycast, already mentioned in section 4.2.1, can be used to ensure reliability of traffic from CE to BR. Since there can be only one Default Mapping Rule per MAP domain, traffic from CE to BR will always use the same destination address.  When this address is anycast, reliability is greatly increased. If a BR goes down, it stops advertising the IPv6 anycast address, and traffic is automatically re-routed to other BRs. For this mechanism to work correctly, it is crucial that the anycast route announcement be very closely tied to BR availability. See [RFC4786] for best current practices on the operation of anycast services. </t>

        <t>Anycast covers global reliability. Reliability within a single link can be achieved with the help of a redundancy protocol such as VRRP [RFC5798]. This allows operation of a pair of BRs in active/standby configuration. No state needs to be shared for the operation of MAP, so there is no need to keep the standby node in a "warm" state: as long as it is up and ready to take over the virtual IPv6 address, quick failover can be achieved. This makes the pair behave as a single, much more reliable node, with less reliance on quick routing protocol convergence for reliability.</t>

        <t>It is expected that production-quality MAP deployments will make use of both anycast and a redundancy protocol such as VRRP.</t>

        <t>3. MTU/Fragmentation</t>

        <t>If the MTU is well-managed such that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the MAP domain, then the 4rd Tunnel MTU can be set to the known IPv6 MTU minus the size of the encapsulating IPv4 header (40 bytes).  For example, if the IPv6 MTU is known to be 1500 bytes, the 4rd Tunnel MTU might be set to 1460 bytes.  Without more specific information, the 4rd Tunnel MTU SHOULD default to 1280 bytes.</t>

        <t>It is important that fragments of a MAP packet sent according to the Default Mapping Rule be handled by the same BR. This can be a problem when using an anycast BR address and routing fluctuations cause fragments of a packet to be routed to multiple BRs.</t>

        <t>BRs using an anycast address as source can cause problems. If traffic sent by a BR with a source anycast address causes an ICMP error to be returned, that error packet's destination address will be an anycast address, meaning that a different BR might receive it. In the case of a Too Big ICMP error, this could cause a path MTU discovery black hole. Another possible problem could occur if fragmented packets from different BRs using the same anycast address as source happen to contain the same fragment ID. This would break fragment reassembly.</t>
        <t>Therefore, when using anycast addresses, it is RECOMMENDED that they be only used as destination address, and never as source addresses. BRs SHOULD be configured to accept traffic sent to the anycast address, but use an unicast address as source.</t>

        <t>In MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are not shared, IPv6 destinations are derived from IPv4 addresses alone.  Thus, each IPv4 packet can be encapsulated and decapsulated independently of each other. 4rd processing is completely stateless.</t>

        <t>On the other hand, in MAP domains where IPv4 addresses are shared, BRs and CEs may have to encapsulate or translate IPv4 packets whose IPv6 destinations depend on destination ports.  Precautions are needed, due to the fact that the destination port of a fragmented datagram is available only in its first fragment.  A sufficient precaution consists in reassembling each datagram received in multiple packets, and to treat it as though it would have been received in single packet.  This function is such that MAP is in this case stateful at the IP layer.  (This is common with DS-lite and NAT64/DNS64 which, in addition, are stateful at the transport layer.)  At domain entrance, this ensures that all pieces of all received IPv4 datagrams go to the right IPv6 destinations.</t>

        <t>Another peculiarity of shared IPv4 addresses is that, without precaution, a destination could simultaneously receive from different sources fragmented datagrams that have the same Datagram ID (the Identification field of [RFC0791]).  This would disturb the reassembly process.  To eliminate this risk, CE MUST rewrite the datagram ID to a unique value among CEs sharing an IPv4 address upon sending the packet over a MAP domain.  This value SHOULD be generated locally within the port-range assigned to a given CE.  Note that replacing a Datagram ID in an IPv4 header implies an update of its Header-checksum field, by adding to it the one's complement difference between the old and the new values.</t>

      <section title="CE settings">

        <t>1. bridging vs. routing</t>

        <t>In routing manner, the CE runs a standard NAT44 [RFC3022] using the allocated public
   address as external IP and ports via DHCPv6 option.  When receiving an IPv4 packet with
   private source address from its end hosts, it performs NAT44 function
   by translating the source address into public and selecting a port
   from the allocated port-set.  Then it encapsulates/translates the packet with
   the concentrator's IPv6 address as destination IPv6 address, and
   forwards it to the concentrator.  When receiving an IPv6
   packet from the concentrator, the initiator decapsulates/translates the IPv6
   packet to get the IPv4 packet with public destination IPv4 address.
   Then it performs NAT44 function and translates the destination
   address into private one. </t>

        <t>The CE is responsible for performing ALG functions (e.g., SIP, FTP),
   as well as supporting NAT Traversal mechanisms (e.g., UPnP, NAT-PMP,
   manual mapping configuration).  This is no different from the
   standard IPv4 NAT today.</t>

       <t>For the bridging manner, end host would run a software performing CE functionalities. In this case, end host gets public address directly.
   It is also suggested that the host run a local NAT to map randomly
   generated ports into the restricted, valid port-set.  Another
   solution is to have the IP stack to only assign ports within the
   restricted, valid range to applications.  Either way the host
   guarantees that every source port number in the outgoing packets
   falls into the allocated port-set.

        <t>2. CE-initiated application</t>

        <t>CE-initiated case is applied for situations where applications run on CE directly. If the application in CE use the public address directly, it might conflict with other CEs. So it is highly suggested that CE should also run a local NAT to map a private address to public address in CE. In this way, the CE IPv4 address passed to local applications would be conflict with other CEs. Moreover, CE should guarantee that every source port number in the outgoing packets falls into the allocated port-set.</t>

        <t>1. Lawful Intercept</t>
<t>Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to
lawful intercept. For details, see [RFC6269] section 12.</t>
        

        <t>2. Traffic Logging</t>
<t>It is always possible for a service provider that operates a MAP domain to determine the IPv6 prefix associated with a MAP IPv4 address (and port number in case of a shared address). This mapping is static, and it is therefore unnecessary to log every IPv4 address assignment. However, changes in that static mapping, such as rule changes in the provisioning system, need to be logged in order to be able to know the mapping at any point in time.</t>

<t>Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to traffic logging. For details, see [RFC6269] sections 8 and 13.1.</t>

<t>Sharing IPv4 addresses among multiple CEs is susceptible to issues related to geo-location. For details, see [RFC6269] section 7.</t>

        <t>4. User Managment (policy control ,etc ... )</t>

<t>MAP IPv4 address assignment, and hence the IPv4 service itself, is tied to the IPv6 prefix lease; thus, the MAP service is also tied to this in terms of authorization, accounting, etc.  For example, the MAP address has the same lifetime as its associated IPv6 prefix.</t>

      IPv4 residual deployment.</t>

      <section title="Planning for Residual Deployment, a Step-by-step Guide">
      <t>Residual deployment starts from IPv6 address planning. </t>

      <t>(A) IPv6 considerations</t>

          <t hangText="(A1)">Determine the maximum number N of CEs to be
          supported, and, for generality, suppose N = 2^n.</t>

          <t hangText="">For example, we suppose n = 20. It means there will
          be up to about one million CEs.</t>

          <t hangText="(A2)">Choose the length x of IPv6 prefixes to be
          assigned to ordinary customers.</t>

          <t hangText="">Consider we have a /32 IPv6 block, it is not a
          problem for the IPv6 deployment with the given number of CEs. Let x
          = 60, allowing subnets inside in each CE delegated networks.</t>

          <t hangText="(A3)">Multiply N by a margin coefficient K, a power of
          two (K = 2 ^ k), to take into account that:</t>

          <t hangText="   -">Some privileged customers may be assigned IPv6
          prefixes of length x', shorter than x, to have larger addressing
          spaces than ordinary customers, both in IPv6 and IPv4;</t>

          <t hangText="   -">Due to the hierarchy of routable prefixes, many
          theoretically delegatable prefixes may not be actually delegatable
          (ref: host density ratio of <xref target="RFC3194"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="">In our example, let's take k = 0 for simplicity.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>(B) IPv4 considerations</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(B1)">List all (non overlapping, not yet assigned to
          any in-running networks) IPv4 prefixes {Hi} that are available for
          IPv4 residual deployment.</t>

          <t hangText="">Suppose that we hold two blocks and not yet assigned
          to any fixed network: 192.32.0.0/16 and 63.245.0.0/16. </t>

          <t hangText="(B2)">Take enough of them, among the shortest ones, to
          get a total whose size M is a power of two (M = 2 ^ m), and includes
          a good proportion of the available IPv4 space.</t>

          <!-- <t hangText="">
	  If the M < N, addresses should be shared by N CEs and thus
	each is shared by N/M = 2^(n - m) CEs with PSID length of 
	(n - m). Once the PSID length is determined, the EA-bit length is 
	determined too, as equals to the sum of PSID length and the IPv4 
	suffix length. 
	  </t>.-->

          <t hangText="">If we use both blocks, M = 2^16 + 2^16, and therefore
          m = 17. Then PSID length could be 3 bits, the corresponding sharing
          ratio is also determined so that each CE can have 8192 ports to use
          under the shared global IPv4 address; and accordingly the EA-bit 
	  length is (32 - 16) + 3 = 19 bits.</t>

          <t hangText="(B3)">For each IPv4 prefix, Hi, of length hi, choose 
          an index, say Ri of length ri = m - (32 - hi).</t>

          <t hangText="">All these indexes must be non overlapping prefixes
          (e.g. 0, 10, 110, 111 for one /10, one /11, and two /12). In our 
	  example, we pick 0 for a contiguous block while 1 for another.</t>

          <t hangText="">Then we have: <figure>
              <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
H1 = 192.32.0.0./16, h1 = 16, r1 = 1 => R1 = bin(0); 
H2 = 63.245.0.0./16, h2 = 16, r2 = 1 => R2 = bin(1); 
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Sometimes the IPv4 residual pool is not well aggregated and the 
	 contiguous blocks may have different sizes. For example, in (B1), 
	 if we have H1 = 59.112.0.0/13 and H2 = 219.120.0.0/16 as the IPv4 
	 residual pool, then M = 2^19 + 2^16, and in such a case, we must 
	 pick m so that m = ceil(log2(M)), where "ceil(x)" means the 
  	 minimum integer not less than x, i.e., m = 20 in this case. 
	 Therefore r1 = 20 - (32 - 13) = 1, while r2 = 20 - (32 - 16) = 4. 
	 Several combinations are available for the R1 and R2 and one only 
	 needs to pay attention to avoiding overlapping when picking up 
	 the values. 
      </t>

      <t>(C) After (A) and (B), derive the rule(s)</t>

      <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="(C1)">Derive the length c of the MAP domain IPv6 prefix,

          length of (c + ri).</t>

          <t hangText="">Then we can do that: <figure>

Rule 2: Rule IPv6 Prefix = 2001:0db8:ff80::/41
]]></artwork>
            </figure>
	  If we have different lengths for the Rule IPv4 prefix (as the extra 
	  example discussed at the end of (B)), their Rule IPv6 prefixes should 
	  not have the same length, as their rule index length is different. 
	  </t>

          <t hangText="">As a result, for a certain CE delegating

CE IPv4 Address = 63.245.48.236
]]></artwork>
            </figure></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If different sharing ratio is demanded, we may partition CEs into
      groups and do (A) and (B) for each group, determining the PSID length
      for them separately.</t>

      <section title="Remarks on Deployment Paradigms">

      <!-- t>Remarks:</t -->

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>IPv6 address planning in residual deployment is independent of
          the usage of the residual IPv4 addresses.
          The IPv4 address pool for "residual deployment" contains IPv4
          addresses not yet allocated to customers/subscribers and/or those
          already recalled from ex-customers, re-programmed into relatively 
	  well-aggregated blocks. </t>

	  <t>It is recommended to have the number of rule entries as less as 
	  possible so that the merit of statelss deployment is reflected in 
	  practical performances. However, this effort is often constrained 
	  by the condition of an operator whether (a): it holds large-enough 
	  contigious IPv4 address block(s) for the residual deployment, and 
	  (b): a short-enough IPv6 domain prefix so that the /64 delegation 
	  is easily satisfied even the EA-bits is quite long. When condition 
	  (a) is not satisfied, sub-domains have to be defined for each 
	  relatively small but contigious aggregated block; when condition 
	  (b) is not satisfied, one has to devide the IPv4 aggregates into 
	  smaller blocks artificially in order to reduce the length of 
	  EA-bits. When we have good conditions fitting (a) and (b), it is 
	  NOT recommended to define short EA-bits with small length of 
	  IPv4 suffix (the value p) nor to increase the number of rule 
	  entries (also the number of sub-domains) unless it really has to.
	  </t>  

          <t>An extreme case is, when EA-bits contain the full IPv4 address 
	  while a full IPv4 address is assigned to a CE, i.e., o = p = 32, 
	  and q = 0, the MAP address format becomes almost equivalent to 
	  RFC6052-format <xref target="RFC6052"></xref> except the off-domain 
	  IPv4 peer's mapped IPv6 address. This frees the domain to distribute 
	  rules but the DMR. 
	  In such a case, IPv6 addressing is fully dependent of IPv4, which 
	  defers from the typical residual deployment case. MAP is mainly 
	  designed for residual deployment but also applied for the case of 
	  legacy IPv4 networks keeping communication with the IPv4 world over 
	  the IPv6 domain without renumbering, as long as the address 
	  planning doesn't matter. </t>

	  <t>Another extreme case is, when EA-bits' length becomes to zero, 
	  i.e., o = p = q = 0, a rule actually defines a correspondence 
	  between an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address (or a prefix), without 
	  any algorithmic correlation to each other. Using such a case in 
	  practice is not prohibited by the specification, but it is not 
	  recommended to deploy null EA-bits in large scale as the concern 
	  discussed in the above Remark 2, and as it has the limitation that 
	  the PSID must be null (q = 0) and therefore multiple CEs sharing 
	  a same IPv4 address is not supported here. It is recommended to 
	  apply a stateful solution, like Lightweight 4over6 
	  <xref target="I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite"></xref>, if 
	  a full de-correlation between IPv6 address and IPv4 address as 
	  well as port range is demanded. </t> 

	  <t>A not-so-extreme case, p = 0, o = q, i.e., only PSID is 
	  applied for the EA-bits, is also a case possibly happening in 
	  practice. It also potentially generates a huge number of rules 
	  and therefore large-scale deployment of this case is not 
	  recommended either. </t>

	  <t>For operators who would like to utilize "some bits" of IPv6 
	  address to do service identification, QoS differentiation, etc., 
	  it is recommended that these special-purpose bits should be 
	  embedded before the EA-bits so as to reduce the possibility of 
	  bit-conflict. However, it requires quite shorter IPv6 aggregate 
	  prefix of the operator. The bit-conflict is more likely to happen
	  in this case if different domains have different Rule prefix lengths. 
	  Operators with this demand should pay attention to the impact on 
	  the domain rule planning. </t>

    <!--   SECTION 6: MIGRATION METHODOLOGY, Gang  -->

    <section title="Migration Methodology">
      <section title="Roadmap for MAP-based Solution">
        <t></t>

        <section title="Start from Scratch">
          <t>IPv6 deployment normally involves a step-wise approach where parts of
   the network should properly updated gradually.  As IPv6 deployment
   progresses it may be simpler for operators to employ a single-version
   network, since deploying both IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel would cost
   more than IPv6-only network.  Therefore switching to an IPv6-only
   network in realtively small scale will become more prevalent.
   Meanwhile, a significant part of network will still stay in IPv4 for
   long time, especially at early stage of IPv6 transition.  There may
   not be enough public or private IPv4 addresses to support end-to-end
   network communication, without segmenting the network into small
   parts with sharing one IPv4 address space.  That is a time to
   introduce MAP to bridge these IPv4 islands through IPv6 network.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Coexiting Phases">
          <t> SP has various deployment strategy in the middle of transition.  It's
   foreseeable that IPv6 would likely coexist with IPv4 in a long
   period.  The MAP deployment would also fit into the coexisting mode.
   To be specific, dual-stack technology is recommended in RFC6180 as
   the simplest deployment model to advance IPv6 deployment.  MAP
   technology could get along well with native IPv6 connections and
   compatible with residual IPv4 networks.  RFC6264 described a
   incremental transition approach in order to migrate networks to IPv6-
   only.  DS-Lite is treated as a technology to accelerate the whole
   process.  MAP can also take the same role to achieve a smooth
   transition.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Exit Strategy ">
          <t> The benefit of IPv6-only + MAP is that all IPv6 flows would go
   directly to the Internet, no need further progressing on
   encapsulation or translation.  In this way, as more content providers
   and service are available over IPv6, the utilization on MAP CE and BR
   goes down since fewer destinations require MAP progressing.  This way
   would advance IPv6, because it provides everyone incentives to use
   IPv6, and eventually the result is an pure IPv6 network with no need
   for IPv4.  As more content providers and hosts equiped with IPv6
   capabilities , the MAP utilization goes down until it is eventually
   not used at all when all content is IPv6.  In this way, MAP has an
   "exit strategy".  The corresponding solutions will leave the network
   in time.</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section title="Migration Mode">
        <t>IPv4 Residual deployment is a interim phase during IPv6 migration.
   It would be beneficial to ISPs, if this phase is as short as possible
   since end-to-end IPv6 traversal is the really goals.  When IPv6 is
   getting more and more mature, MAP would be retired in a natural way
   or enforced by particular considerations.</t>

        <section title="Passive Transition">
          <t>Passive Transition is following IPv4 retirement law.  In another
   word, MAP would always get along with IPv4 appearance, even all nodes
   is dual-stack capable.  At a later stage of IPv6 migration, MAP can
   also be served for dual-stack hosts, which is sending traffic through
   the IPv4 stack.  There is still a value for this approach because it
   could steer IPv4 traffic to IPv6 going through a MAP CE processing.
   When it comes the time ISP decide to turn off IPv4, MAP would be
   faded due to IPv4 disappearance.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Active Transition">
          <t>Active Transition is targeting to acclerate IPv4 exit and increase
   native IPv6 utilization.  A desirable way deploying MAP is only
   providing IPv6 traversal ability to a IPv4-only host.  However, MAP
   CE can not determine received traffic is send from a IPv4 node or a
   dual-stack node.  In the latter case, IPv6 utilization is prefered in
   a common case.  When a network evolve to a post-IPv6 era.  It might
   be good for ISP to consider implement enforcements rules to help IPv6
   migration.  There is a set of approach would help the situation.</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
      <t>ISP could install only IPv6 record (i.e.  AAAA) in DNS server,
      which would provide users with IPv6 steering effects.  When a host
      is IPv6-capable and gets IPv6 DNS reply in advance, MAP
      functionalities would be restricted by IPv6-only record response.</t>

      <t>ISP could retrieve shared IPv4 address by increasing sharing
      ratio.  In this case, number of concurrent IPv4 sessions on MAP CE
      would be suppressed.  It would encourage native IPv6 growth in
      some extent.</t>

      <t>ISP could allocate a dedicated IPv6 prefix for MAP deployment.
      The allocation could not only facilitate the differentiation
      between MAPed traffic and native IPv6 trafffic, but also clearly
      observe the tendency of MAP traffic.  When the traffic is getting
      down for while, ISP could close the MAP functionalities in some
      specific area.  It would result networks to native IPv6-only
      capable.</t>
