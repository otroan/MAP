    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism for transporting IPv4 packets
      across an IPv6 network using IP encapsulation, and a generic mechanism
      for mapping between IPv6 addresses and IPv4 addresses and transport
      layer ports.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mapping of IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses has been described in
      numerous mechanisms dating back to 1996 <xref target="RFC1933"></xref>.
      The Automatic tunneling mechanism described in RFC1933, assigned a
      globally unique IPv6 address to a host by combining the host's IPv4
      address with a well-known IPv6 prefix. Given an IPv6 packet with a
      destination address with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could
      automatically tunnel this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-point
      address from the IPv6 destination address.</t>

      <t>There are numerous variations of this idea, described in 6over4 <xref
      target="RFC2529"></xref>, 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"></xref>, ISATAP
      <xref target="RFC5214"></xref>, and 6rd <xref
      target="RFC5969"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The commonalities of all these IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms are: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Automatically provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an IPv6
          prefix for a site</t>

          <t>Algorithmic or implicit address resolution of tunnel end point
          addresses. Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4 tunnel
          endpoint address can be calculated.</t>

          <t>Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof into an IPv6
          address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv6 only networks will be
      common, while there will still be a need for residual IPv4 deployment.
      This document describes a generic mapping of IPv4 to IPv6, and a
      mechanism for encapsulating IPv4 over IPv6.</t>

      <t>Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms referred to above, the residual
      IPv4 over IPv6 mechanism must be capable of:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
          address.</t>

          <t>Algorithmically map between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or a
          shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The mapping scheme described here supports encapsulation of IPv4
      packets in IPv6 in both mesh and hub and spoke topologies, including
      address mappings with full independence between IPv6 and IPv4
      addresses.</t>

      <t>This document describes delivery of IPv4 unicast service across an
      IPv6 infrastructure. IPv4 multicast is not considered further in this
      document.</t>

      <t>The A+P (Address and Port) architecture of sharing an IPv4 address by
      distributing the port space is described in <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref>. Specifically section 4 of <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref> covers stateless mapping. The corresponding
      stateful solution DS-lite is described in <xref
      target="RFC6333"></xref>. The motivation for the work is described in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A companion document defines a DHCPv6 option for provisioning of MAP
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp"></xref>. Other means of
      provisioning is possible. Deployment considerations are described in
      [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-deployment].</t>

      <t>MAP relies on IPv6 and is designed to deliver production-quality
      dual-stack service while allowing IPv4 to be phased out within the SP
      network. The phasing out of IPv4 within the SP network is independent of
      whether the end user disables IPv4 service or not. Further,
      "Greenfield"; IPv6-only networks may use MAP in order to deliver IPv4 to
      sites via the IPv6 network.</t>

        </list></t>
    </section>

    <!--  SECTION 3: DESCRIPTION                   -->

    <section title="Architecture">
      <t>The MAP mechanism uses existing standard building blocks. The
      existing NAT44 on the CE is used with additional support for restricting
      transport protocol ports, ICMP identifiers and fragment identifiers to
      the configured port set. MAP supports the encapsulation mode specified
      in <xref target="RFC2473"></xref>. In addition MAP specifies an
      algorithm to do "address resolution" from an IPv4 address and port to an
      IPv6 address. This algorithmic mapping is specified in <xref
      target="mapping_algorithm"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A full IPv4 address or IPv4 prefix can be used like today, e.g. For
      identifying an interface or as a DHCP pool. A shared IPv4 address on the
      other hand, MUST NOT be used to identify an interface. While it is
      theoretically possible to make host stacks and applications port-aware,
      that is considered a too drastic change to the IP model <xref
      target="RFC6250"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The MAP architecture described here, restricts the use of the shared
      IPv4 address to only be used as the global address (outside) of the NAPT
      <xref target="RFC2663"></xref> running on the CE. The NAPT MUST in turn
      be connected to a MAP aware forwarding function, that does
      encapsulation/decapsulation of IPv4 packets in IPv6.</t>

      <t>When MAP is used to provision a full IPv4 address or an IPv4 prefix
      to the CE, these restrictions do not apply.</t>

      <t>For packets outbound from the private IPv4 network, the CE NAPT MUST
      translate transport identifiers (e.g. TCP and UDP port numbers) so that
      they fall within the assigned CE's port-range.</t>

      <t>The forwarding function uses the Rules table to make forwarding
      decisions. The table consists of the mapping rules. An entry in the
      table consists of an IPv4 prefix and PSID.</t>

      <!--
 The normal best matching prefix algorithm is used. With a
      maximum key length of 48 (Length of IPv4 address (32) + Length
      of Transport layer port field (16)). E.g. with a sharing ratio
      of 64 (6 bit PSID length), a "host route" for this CE would be a
      /38 (32 + 6).</t>

      <t>The MAP BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
      the IPv4 nodes in one or more MAP domains.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="mapping_algorithm" title="Mapping Algorithm">
      <t>A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.</t>

      <t>Mapping rules are used differently depending on their function. Every
      MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic mapping rule. This is used by
      the node to configure its IPv4 address, IPv4 prefix or shared IPv4
      address. This same basic rule can also be used for forwarding, where an
      IPv4 destination address and optionally a destination port is mapped
      into an IPv6 address. Additional mapping rules are specified to allow
      for multiple different IPv4 sub-nets to exist within the domain and
      optimize forwarding between them.</t>

      <t>Traffic outside of the domain (i.e. When the destination IPv4 address
      does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule IPv4 prefix in
      the Rules database) will be forward using the Default mapping rule. The
      Default mapping rule maps outside destinations to the BR's IPv6
      address.</t>

      <t>There are three types of mapping rules: <list style="numbers">
          <t>Basic Mapping Rule - used for IPv4 prefix, address or port set
          assignment. There can only be one Basic Mapping Rule per End-user
          IPv6 prefix. The Basic Mapping Rule is used to configure the MAP
          IPv6 address or prefix. <list style="symbols">
              <t>Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

              <t>Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

              <t>Rule EA-bits length (in bits)</t>

              <t>Rule Port Parameters (optional)</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Forwarding Mapping Rule - used for forwarding. The Basic Mapping
          Rule is also a Forwarding Mapping Rule. Each Forwarding Mapping Rule
          will result in an entry in the Rules table for the Rule IPv4 prefix.
          The FMR consists of the same parameters as the BMR.</t>

          <t>Default Mapping Rule - used for destinations outside the MAP
          domain. A 0.0.0.0/0 entry is installed in the Rules table for this
          rule. <list style="symbols">
              <t>IPv6 address of BR</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>A MAP node finds its Basic Mapping Rule by doing a longest match
      between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix in the Mapping
      Rules table. The rule is then used for IPv4 prefix, address or shared
      address assignment.</t>

      <t>A MAP IPv6 address is formed from the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix. This
      address MUST be assigned to an interface of the MAP node and is used to
      terminate all MAP traffic being sent or received to the node.</t>

      <t>Port-aware IPv4 entries in the Rules table are installed for all the
      Forwarding Mapping Rules and an IPv4 default route for the Default
      Mapping Rule.</t>

      <t>In hub and spoke mode, all traffic MUST be forwarded using the
      Default Mapping Rule.</t>

      <section title="Port mapping algorithm">
        <t>The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules allow
        IPv4 address sharing. Different Port-Set Identifiers (PSID) MUST have
        non-overlapping port-sets. The two extreme cases are: (1) the port
        numbers are not contiguous for each PSID, but uniformly distributed
        across the port range (0-65535); (2) the port numbers are contiguous

        <t>The Rule IPv6 prefix is the part of the End-user IPv6 prefix that
        is common among all CEs using the same Basic Mapping Rule within the
        MAP domain. The EA bits encode the CE specific IPv4 address and port
        information. The EA bits, which are unique for a given Rule IPv6
        prefix, can contain a full or part of an IPv4 address and, in the
        shared IPv4 address case, a Port-Set Identifier (PSID). An EA-bit
        length of 0 signifies that all relevant MAP IPv4 addressing
        information is passed directly in the BMR rule, and not derived from
        the End-user IPv6 prefix.</t>

        <t>The MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the End-user IPv6
        prefix with the MAP subnet-id and the interface-id as specified in
        <xref target="interface-id"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The MAP subnet ID is defined to be the first subnet (all bits set
        to zero). A MAP node MUST reserve the first IPv6 prefix in an End-user
        IPv6 prefix for the purpose of MAP.</t>

        <t>The MAP IPv6 is created by combining the End-User IPv6 prefix with
        the all zeros subnet-id and the MAP IPv6 interface identifier.</t>

        <t>The length of r MAY be zero, in which case the complete IPv4
        address or prefix is encoded in the EA bits. If only a part of the
        IPv4 address/prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the Rule IPv4 prefix is
        provisioned to the CE by other means (e.g. a DHCPv6 option). To create
        a complete IPv4 address (or prefix), the IPv4 address suffix (p) from
        the EA bits, are concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r bits).</t>

        <t>The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is equal to the
        BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length. The length of the EA bits field (o) is
        given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length, and can be between 0 and 48. The
        sum of the Rule IPv6 Prefix length and the Rule EA-bits length MUST be
        less or equal than the End-user IPv6 prefix length.</t>

        <t>If o + r &lt; 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then an IPv4
        prefix is assigned.</t>

        <t>If o + r is equal to 32, then a full IPv4 address is to be
        assigned. The address is created by concatenating the Rule IPv4 prefix
        and the EA-bits.</t>

        <t>If o + r is &gt; 32, then a shared IPv4 address is to be assigned.
        The number of IPv4 address suffix bits (p) in the EA bits is given by
        32 - r bits. The PSID bits are used to create a port-set. The length
        of the PSID bit field within EA bits is: o - p.</t>

        <t>The length of r MAY be 32, with no part of the IPv4 address
        embedded in the EA bits. This results in a mapping with no dependence
        between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address. In addition the length
        of o MAY be zero (no EA bits embedded in the End-User IPv6 prefix),
        meaning that also the PSID is provisioned using e.g. The DHCP
        option.</t>

        <t>In the following examples, only the suffix (last 8 bits) of the
        IPv4 address is embedded in the EA bits (r = 24), while the IPv4
        prefix (first 24 bits) is given in the BMR Rule IPv4 prefix.</t>

        manners, including provisioning methods such as the Broadband Forum's
        "TR-69" Residential Gateway management interface, an XML-based object
        retrieved after IPv6 connectivity is established, or manual
        configuration by an administrator. This document describes how to
        configure the necessary parameters via a single DHCPv6 option. A CE
        that allows IPv6 configuration by DHCP SHOULD implement this option.
        Other configuration and management methods may use the format

        implementation on CEs that support multiple configuration methods.</t>

        order to calculate the MAP IPv4 address and enable IPv4 connectivity
        is the IPv6 prefix for the CE. The End-user IPv6 prefix is configured
        as part of obtaining IPv6 Internet access.</t>

        <t>A single MAP CE MAY be connected to more than one MAP domain, just
        as any router may have more than one IPv4-enabled service provider
        facing interface and more than one set of associated addresses
        assigned by DHCP. Each domain a given CE operates within would require

        <t>The MAP BR MUST be configured with the same MAP elements as the MAP
        CEs operating within the same domain.</t>

        <t>For increased reliability and load balancing, the BR IPv6 address
        MAY be an anycast address shared across a given MAP domain. As MAP is
        stateless, any BR may be used at any time. If the BR IPv6 address is
        anycast the relay MUST use this anycast IPv6 address as the source
        address in packets relayed to CEs.</t>

        <t>Since MAP uses provider address space, no specific routes need to
        be advertised externally for MAP to operate, neither in IPv6 nor IPv4
        BGP. However, if anycast is used for the MAP IPv6 relays, the anycast
        addresses must be advertised in the service provider's IGP.</t>

      <section title="Backwards compatibility">
        <t>A MAP-E CE provisioned with only a Default Mapping Rule, and with
        no IPv4 address and port range configured by other means, MUST disable
        its NAT44 functionality. This characteristic makes a MAP CE compatible
        with DS-Lite <xref target="RFC6333"></xref> AFTRs, whose addresses are
        configured as the MAP BR.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Address Independence">
        <t>The MAP solution supports use and configuration of domains in so
        called 1:1 mode (meaning 1 mapping rule set per CE), which allows
        complete independence between the IPv6 prefix assigned to the CE and
        the IPv4 address and/or port-range it uses. This is achieved in all
        cases when the EA-bit length is set to 0.</t>

        <t>The constraint imposed is that each such MAP domain be composed of
        just 1 MAP CE which has a pre-determined IPv6 prefix, i.e. The BR
        would be configured with a rule-set per CPE, where the FMR would
        uniquely describe the IPv6 prefix of a given CE. Each CE would have a
        distinct BMR, that would fully describe that CE's IPv4 address, and
        PSID if any. Note: All rules are provisioned on the CE using means
        like the DHCPv6 MAP option, or other provisioning mechanism . It
        should also be noted that mesh mode communication is still possible in
        1:1 mode domains by configuring appropriate FMRs on each CE, with one
        FMR per correspondent CE.</t>

        <t>There are two specific cases of the 1:1 mode supported by MAP that
        deserve to be described.</t>

        <section title="1:1 mode with no address sharing">
          <t>A domain rule (BMR or FMR) with a setting of EA-bit length of 0,
          and a sharing ratio of 1, indicates that in that domain no part of
          the IPv4 address is derived from the IPv6 prefix. Instead the IPv4
          address is entirely derived from the Rule IPv4-prefix conveyed in
          the BMR for a CE. In other words, with an EA-bit length of 0 and a
          sharing ratio of 1, the CE would form its IPv4 address entirely out
          of the IPv4-prefix received in the BMR (which would be 32 bits
          long).</t>

          <t>Appendix A gives an example of this configuration.</t>

    <section title="Forwarding Considerations">
      <t>Figure 1 depicts the overall MAP architecture with IPv4 users (N and
      M) networks connected to a routed IPv6 network.</t>

      <t>MAP supports Encapsulation mode as specified in <xref
      target="RFC2473"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A MAP CE forwarding IPv4 packets from the LAN performs NAT44
      functions first and create appropriate NAT44 bindings. The resulting
      IPv4 packets MUST contain the source IPv4 address and source transport
      number defined by MAP. The resulting IPv4 packet is forwarded to the
      CE's MAP forwarding function. The IPv6 source and destination addresses
      MUST then be derived as per <xref target="mapping_algorithm"></xref> of
      this draft.</t>

      <t>A MAP CE receiving an IPv6 packet to its MAP IPv6 address sends this
      packet to the CE's MAP function. All other IPv6 traffic is forwarded as
      per the CE's IPv6 routing rules. The resulting IPv4 packet is then
      forwarded to the CE&rsquo;s NAT44 function where the destination port
      number MUST be checked against the stateful port mapping session table
      and the destination port number MUST be mapped to its original
      value.</t>

      <section title="Receiving rules">
        <t>The CE SHOULD check that MAP received packets' transport-layer
        destination port number is in the range configured by MAP for the CE
        and the CE SHOULD drop any non conforming packet and respond with an
        ICMPv6 "Address Unreachable" (Type 1, Code 3).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MAP BR">
        <section title="IPv6 to IPv4">
          <t>A MAP BR receiving IPv6 packets selects a best matching MAP
          domain rule based on a longest address match of the packets' source
          address against the BR's configured MAP BMR prefix(es), as well as a
          match of the packet destination address against the configured BR
          prefixes or FMR prefix(es). The selected MAP rule allows the BR to
          determine the EA-bits from the source IPv6 address. The BR MUST
          perform a validation of the consistency of the source IPv6 address
          and source port number for the packet using BMR. If the packets
          source port number is found to be outside the range allowed for this
          CE and the BMR, the BR MUST drop the packet and respond with an
          ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable, Source address failed
          ingress/egress policy" (Type 1, Code 5).</t>

    <section title="ICMP">
      <t>ICMP message should be supported in MAP domain. Hence, the NAT44 in
      MAP CE must implement the behavior for ICMP message conforming to the
      best current practice documented in <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If a MAP CE receives an ICMP message having ICMP identifier field in
      ICMP header, NAT44 in the MAP CE must rewrite this field to a specific
      value assigned from the port-set. BR and other CEs must handle this
      field similar to the port number in the TCP/UDP header upon receiving
      the ICMP message with ICMP identifier field.</t>

      <t>If a MAP node receives an ICMP error message without the ICMP
      identifier field for errors that is detected inside a IPv6 tunnel, a
      node should relay the ICMP error message to the original source. This
      behavior should be implemented conforming to the section 8 of <xref
      target="RFC2473"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery">
      <t>Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, handling the
      maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
      connecting the two address families. There are three mechanisms to
      handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
      transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
      option <xref target="RFC0897"></xref>. MAP uses all three mechanisms to
      deal with different cases.</t>

      <section title="Fragmentation in the MAP domain">
        <t>Encapsulating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP domain will
        increase its size (40 bytes). It is strongly recommended that the MTU
        in the MAP domain is well managed and that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN
        side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the
        boundary of the MAP domain.</t>

        <t>Fragmentation on MAP domain entry is described in section 7.2 of
        <xref target="RFC2473"></xref></t>

        <t>The use of an anycast source address could lead to any ICMP error
        message generated on the path being sent to a different BR. Therefore,
        using dynamic tunnel MTU Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC2473"></xref>
        is subject to IPv6 Path MTU black-holes.</t>

        <t>Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could send
        fragmented packets to the same CE at the same time. If the fragmented
        packets from different BRs happen to use the same fragment ID,
        incorrect reassembly might occur.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders">
        <t>Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of the MAP
        domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the transport
        protocol destination port. The transport protocol information is only
        available in the first fragment received. As described in section
        5.3.3 of <xref target="RFC6346"></xref> a MAP node receiving an IPv4
        fragmented packet from outside has to reassemble the packet before
        sending the packet onto the MAP link. If the first packet received
        contains the transport protocol information, it is possible to
        optimize this behavior by using a cache and forwarding the fragments
        unchanged. A description of this algorithm is outside the scope of
        this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside">
        <t>If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same IPv4
        address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host outside the
        domain. Those hosts may use the same IPv4 fragmentation identifier,
        resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination
        host. Given that the IPv4 fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit field,
        it could be used similarly to port ranges. A MAP CE SHOULD rewrite the
        IPv4 fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated port set.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="NAT44 Considerations">
      <t>The NAT44 implemented in the MAP CE SHOULD conform with the behavior

      <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5382"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC5383"></xref>. In MAP address sharing mode (determined by the
      MAP domain/rule configuration parameters) the operation of the NAT44
      MUST be restricted to the available port numbers derived via the basic
      mapping rule.</t>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">
      <section title="Use cases">
	<section title="Hub and spoke with per subscriber rules">
	  <t>Existing IPv4 service can be realized with MAP using a

	  <t>The operator has the choice of provisioning a full IPv4
	  address to the end-user, or a shared IPv4 address by also
	  provisioning the PSID in the DHCPv6 option. A hybrid of this
	  use case is to provision the full IPv4 address in the DHCPv6
	  option, while embedding the PSID in the IPv6 prefix. That
	  will result in one mapping rule per IPv4 address, e.g. with

          <t hangText="Denial-of-service attacks:">In MAP domains where IPv4
          addresses are shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram reassembly may be

          inherent to address sharing, and is common with other address
          sharing approaches such as DS-Lite and NAT64/DNS64. The best
          protection against such attacks is to accelerate IPv6 enablement in
          both clients and servers so that, where MAP is supported, it is less
          and less used.</t>

          <t hangText="Routing-loop attacks:">This attack may exist in some

   Another example can be made of a hypothetical MAP BR,
   configured with the following FMR when receiving a packet
   with the following characteristics:

   IPv4 source address:  1.2.3.4 (0x01020304)
   IPv4 source port:  80
   IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)

      16 (Rule EA-bits length)}

   MAP BR Prefix  2001:db8:ffff::/64

   The above information allows the BR to derive as follows
   the mapped destination IPv6 address for the corresponding
   MAP CE, and also the mapped source IPv6 address for
   the IPv4 source.

   An IPv4 host behind the MAP CE (addressed as per the previous
   examples) corresponding with IPv4 host 1.2.3.4 will have its
   packets converted into IPv6 using the DMR configured on the MAP
   CE as follows:

   Default Mapping Rule used by MAP CE:  {2001:db8:ffff::/64
   (Rule IPv6 prefix), 0.0.0.0/0 (Rule IPv4 prefix), null (BR IPv4
      address)}

   IPv4 source address (post NAT44 if present)  192.0.2.18
   IPv4 destination address:  1.2.3.4
   IPv4 source port (post NAT44 if present):  9030
   IPv4 destination port:  80
   IPv6 source address of MAP CE:
                        2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400

          <preamble>Example 4 - 1:1 Rule with no address sharing</preamble>

          <artwork><![CDATA[   IPv6 prefix assigned to the end user:  2001:db8:0012:3400::/56
   Basic Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/56 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
      192.0.2.1/32 (Rule IPv4 prefix), 0 (Rule EA-bits length)}
   Sharing ratio:  1
   PSID offset:  n/a

   A MAP node (CE or BR) can via the BMR or equivalent FMR, determine the IPv4 address
   and port-set as shown below:

   EA bits offset:  0
   IPv4 suffix bits (p)  Length of IPv4 address (32) - IPv4 prefix
      length (32) = 0
   IPv4 address  192.0.2.1 (0xc0000201)
   PSID start:  0
   PSID length: 0
   PSID:  null

   The BMR information allows a MAP CE also to determine (complete)
   its full IPv6 address by combining the IPv6 prefix with the MAP interface
   identifier (that embeds the IPv4 address).

   IPv6 address of MAP CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:0100:0000

   Sharing ratio:  256 (16 - (32 - 24) = 8. 2^8 = 256)

   A MAP node (CE or BR) can via the BMR or equivalent FMR determine the IPv4 address
   and port-set as shown below:

   EA bits offset:  0
   IPv4 suffix bits (p)  Length of IPv4 address (32) - IPv4 prefix
      length (32) = 0
   IPv4 address  192.0.2.1 (0xc0000201)

   The BMR information allows a MAP CE also to determine (complete)
   its full IPv6 address by combining the IPv6 prefix with the MAP interface
   identifier (that embeds the IPv4 address and PSID).

   IPv6 address of MAP CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400

   Note that the IPv4 address and PSID is not derived from the IPv6 prefix assigned to the CE.
