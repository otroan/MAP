    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism for transporting IPv4
      packets across an IPv6 network, and a generic mechanism for
      mapping between IPv6 addresses and IPv4 addresses and transport
      layer ports.</t>
    </abstract>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mapping IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses has been described
      in numerous mechanisms dating back to 1996 <xref
      target="RFC1933"></xref>. The Automatic tunneling mechanism
      described in RFC1933, assigned a globally unique IPv6 address to
      a host by combining the host's IPv4 address with a well-known
      IPv6 prefix. Given an IPv6 packet with a destination address
      with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could automatically tunnel
      this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-point address from
      the IPv6 destination address.</t>

      <t>There are numerous variations of this idea, described in
      6over4 <xref target="RFC2529"></xref>, 6to4 <xref
      target="RFC3056"></xref>, ISATAP <xref target="RFC5214"></xref>,
      and 6rd <xref target="RFC5969"></xref>.</t>


 <!--
 The differences between
      these are the use of well-known IPv6 prefixes, or Service
      Provider assigned IPv6 prefixes, and the position of the
      embedded IPv4 bits in the IPv6 address. Teredo <xref
      target="RFC4380"></xref> added a twist to this to achieve NAT
      traversal by also encoding transport layer ports into the IPv6
      address. 6rd, to achieve more efficient encoding, allowed for
      only the suffix of an IPv4 address to be embedded, with the IPv4
      prefix being deduced from other provisioning mechanisms.</t>

      <t>NAT-PT <xref target="RFC2766"></xref>(deprecated) combined
      with a DNS ALG used address mapping to put NAT state, namely the
      IPv6 to IPv4 binding encoded in an IPv6 address. This
      characteristic has been inherited by NAT64 <xref
      target="RFC6146"></xref> and DNS64 <xref
      target="RFC6147"></xref> which rely on an address format defined
      in <xref target="RFC6052"></xref>. <xref
      target="RFC6052"></xref> specifies the algorithmic translation
      of an IPv6 address to IPv4 address. In particular, <xref
      target="RFC6052"></xref> specifies the address format to build
      IPv4-converted and IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses. RFC6052
      discusses the transport of the port-set information in an
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 address but the conclusion was the following
      (excerpt from [RFC6052]):</t>

      <t>"There have been proposals to complement stateless
      translation with a port range feature. Instead of mapping an
      IPv4 address to exactly one IPv6 prefix, the options would allow
      several IPv6 nodes to share an IPv4 address, with each node
      managing a different set of ports. If a port-set extension is
      needed, it could be defined later, using bits currently reserved
      as null in the suffix."</t>
-->

      <t>The commonalities of all these IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms are:
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>Automatically provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an
	IPv6 prefix for a site</t>
	<t>Algorithmic or implicit address resolution for tunneling or
	encapsulation. Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4
	tunnel endpoint address can be calculated. Likewise for
	translation, an IPv4 address can be calculated from an IPv6
	destination address and vice versa.</t>
	<t>Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof and optionally
	transport layer ports into an IPv6 address.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>In phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv6 only networks will
      be common, while there will still be a need for residual IPv4
      deployment. This document describes a generic mapping of IPv4 to
      IPv6, and mechanisms for encapsulation (IPv4 over IPv6) and
      translation between the two protocols that use this mapping.</t>
      
      <t>Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms referred to above, the
      residual IPv4 over IPv6 mechanisms must be capable of:</t>
      <t><list style="symbols">
	<t>Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
	address.</t>
	<t>Algorithmically map between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or
	a shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>The unified mapping scheme described here supports
      translation mode, encapsulation mode, in both mesh and hub and
      spoke topologies, including 1:1 address mappings with full
      independence between the IPv6 and IPv4 addressing.</t>

      <t>This document describes delivery of IPv4 unicast service
      across an IPv6 infrastructure. IPv4 multicast is not considered
      further in this document.</t>

      <t>The A+P (Address and Port) architecture of sharing an IPv4
      address by distributing the port space is described in <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref>. Specifically section 4 of <xref
      target="RFC6346"/> covers stateless mapping. The corresponding
      stateful solution DS-lite is described in <xref
      target="RFC6333"></xref>. The motivation for the work is
      described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A companion document defines a DHCPv6 option for provisioning
      of MAP <xref
      target="I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option"></xref>. Other means
      of provisioning is possible. Deployment considerations are
      described in [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-deployment].</t>


      <t>MAP relies on IPv6 and is designed to deliver
      production-quality dual-stack service while allowing IPv4 to be
      phased out within the SP network. The phasing out of IPv4 within
      the SP network is independent of whether the end user disables
      IPv4 service or not. Further, "Greenfield"; IPv6-only networks
      may use MAP in order to deliver IPv4 to sites via the IPv6
      network.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 3: DESCRIPTION                   -->

    <section title="Architecture">
      <t>The MAP mechanism is largely built up using existing standard
      building blocks. The existing NAT44 on the CE is used with
      additional support for restricting transport protocol ports,
      ICMP identifiers and fragment identifiers to the configured port
      set. MAP supports two forwarding modes, one using stateless
      NAT64 as specified in <xref target="RFC6145"/> and one
      encapsulation mode specifed in <xref target="RFC2473"/>. In
      addition MAP specifies an algorithm to do "address resolution"
      from an IPv4 address and port to an IPv6 address. This
      algorithmic mapping is specified in section 5.</t>

      <t>A full IPv4 address or IPv4 prefix can be used like today,
      e.g. for identifying an interface or as a DHCP pool. A shared
      IPv4 address on the other hand, MUST NOT be used to identify an
      interface. While it is theoretically possible to make host
      stacks and applications port-aware, that is considered a too
      drastic change to the IP model <xref target="RFC6250"/>.</t>

      <t>The MAP architecture described here, restricts the use of the
      shared IPv4 address to only be used as the global address
      (outside) of the NAPT <xref target="RFC2663"/> running on the
      CE. The NAPT MUST in turn be connected to a MAP aware forwarding
      function, that does encapsulation/decapsulation or translation
      to IPv6.</t>

      <t>When MAP is used to provision a full IPv4 address or an IPv4
      prefix to the CE, these restrictions do not apply.</t>

      <t>For packets outbound from the private IPv4 network, the CE
      NAPT MUST translate transport identifiers (e.g. TCP and UDP port
      numbers) so that they fall within the assigned CE's
      port-range.</t>

      <t>The forwarding function uses the Mapping Rule Table (MRT) to
      make forwarding decisions. The table consist of the mapping
      rules. An entry in the table consists of an IPv4 prefix and
      PSID. The normal best matching prefix algorithm is used. With a
      maximum key length of 48 (Length of IPv4 address (32) + Length
      of Transport layer port field (16)). E.g. with a sharing ratio
      of 64 (6 bit PSID length) a "host route" for this CE would be a
      /38 (32 + 6).</t>

      <t>The MAP BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
      all devices in one or more MAP domains.</t>

      <t>The translation mode allows communication between both
      IPv4-only and any IPv6 enabled end hosts, with native IPv6-only
      servers which are using IPv4-mapped IPv6 address based on DMR in
      the MAP-T domain. In this mode, the IPv6-only servers SHOULD
      have both A and AAAA records in the authorities DNS server <xref
      target="RFC6219"></xref>. DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"></xref>
      become required only when IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain are
      expected themselves to initiate communication to external
      IPv4-only hosts.</t>

      <t>The NAT44 implemented in MAP-T CE SHOULD conform with the behavior
      and best current practice documented in <xref target="RFC4787"></xref>,
      <xref target="RFC5508"> </xref> and <xref target="RFC5382"></xref>. In
      MAP-T address sharing mode (determined by the MAP-T configuration

    <section title="Mapping Algorithm">
      <t>A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.</t>

      <t>Mapping rules are used differently depending on their
      function. Every MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic
      mapping rule. This is used by the node to configure its IPv4
      address, IPv4 prefix or shared IPv4 address. This same basic
      rule can also be used for forwarding, where an IPv4 destination
      address and optionally a destination port is mapped into an IPv6
      address or prefix. Additional mapping rules are specified to
      allow for e.g. multiple different IPv4 subnets to exist within
      the domain and optimize forwarding between them.</t>

      <t>Traffic outside of the domain (i.e. when the destination IPv4
      address does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule
      IPv4 prefix in the Rules database) will be forward using the
      Default mapping rule. The Default mapping rule maps outside
      destinations to the BR's IPv6 address or prefix.</t>

      <t>There are three types of mapping rules:
      <list style="numbers">

	<t>Basic Mapping Rule - used for IPv4 prefix, address or port
	set assignment. There can only be one Basic Mapping Rule per
	End-user IPv6 prefix. The Basic Mapping Rule is used to
	configure the MAP IPv6 address or prefix.
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)</t>
	  <t>Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)</t>
	  <t>Rule EA-bits length (in bits)</t>
	  <t>Rule Port Parameters (optional)</t>
	  <t>Forwarding mode</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>Forwarding Mapping Rule - used for forwarding. The Basic
	Mapping Rule is also a Forwarding Mapping Rule. Each
	Forwarding Mapping Rule will result in an entry in the MRT for
	the Rule IPv4 prefix. The FMR consists of the same parameters
	as the BMR.</t>

	<t>Default Mapping Rule - used for destinations outside the
	MAP domain. A 0.0.0.0/0 entry is installed in the MRT for this
	rule.
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>IPv6 prefix of address of BR</t>
	  <t>Forwarding mode</t>
	</list></t>

      </list></t>

      <t>A MAP node finds its Basic Mapping Rule by doing a longest
      match between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix
      in the Mapping Rule database. The rule is then used for IPv4
      prefix, address or shared address assignment.</t>

      <t>A MAP IPv6 address (or prefix) is formed from the BMR Rule
      IPv6 prefix. This address MUST be assigned to an interface of
      the MAP node and is used to terminate all MAP traffic being sent
      or received to the node.</t>

      <t>Port-aware IPv4 entries in the MRT are installed for all the
      Forwarding Mapping Rules and an IPv4 default route for the
      Default Mapping Rule.</t>

      <t>In hub and spoke mode, all traffic MUST be forwarded using
      the Default Mapping Rule.</t>

      <section title="Port mapping algorithm">
	<t>The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules
	allow IPv4 address sharing. Different Port-Set Identifiers
	(PSID) MUST have non-overlapping port-sets. The two extreme
	cases are: (1) the port numbers are not contiguous for each
	PSID, but uniformly distributed across the port range
	(0-65535); (2) the port numbers are contiguous in a single
	range for each PSID. The port mapping algorithm proposed here
	is called the Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) and supports
	both these cases.</t>

	<t>For a given sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of
	contiguous ports (M), the GMA algorithm is defined as:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">

	  <t>The port number (P) of a given PSID (K) is composed of:
	  <figure><artwork>
P = R * M * j + M * K + i

	  Where:<list style="symbols">
	  <t>PSID: K = 0 to R - 1</t>

	  <t>Port range index: j = (4096 / M) / R to ((65536 / M) / R) - 1, if the
	  port numbers (0 - 4095) are excluded.</t>

	  <t>Contiguous Port index: i = 0 to M - 1</t>
	  </list></t>

	  <t>The PSID (K) of a given port number (P) is determined by:

	<t>The Embedded Address bits (EA bits) are unique per end user
	within a Rule IPv6 prefix. The Rule IPv6 prefix is the part of
	the End-user IPv6 prefix that is common among all CEs using
	the same Basic Mapping Rule within the MAP domain. The EA bits
	encode the CE specific IPv4 address and port information. The
	EA bits can contain a full or part of an IPv4 prefix or
	address, and in the shared IPv4 address case contains a
	Port-Set Identifier (PSID).</t>

	<t>The MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the
	End-user IPv6 prefix with the MAP subnet-id and the
	interface-id as specified in <xref target="interface-id"/>.</t>

	<t>The MAP subnet ID is defined to be the first subnet (all
	bits set to zero). A MAP node MUST reserve the first IPv6
	prefix in a End-user IPv6 prefix for the purpose of MAP.</t>

	<t>The MAP IPv6 is created by combining the End-User IPv6
	prefix with the all zeros subnet-id and the MAP IPv6 interface

	<t>The length of r MAY be zero, in which case the complete
	IPv4 address or prefix is encoded in the EA bits. If only a
	part of the IPv4 address/prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the
	Rule IPv4 prefix is provisioned to the CE by other means
	(e.g. a DHCPv6 option). To create a complete IPv4 address (or
	prefix), the IPv4 address suffix (p) from the EA bits, are
	concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r bits).</t>

	<t>The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is
 	equal to the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length. The length of the EA
	bits field (o) is given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length. The
	sum of the Rule IPv6 Prefix length and the Rule EA-bits length
	MUST be less or equal than the End-user IPv6 prefix length.</t>

	<t>If o + r &lt; 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then
	an IPv4 prefix is assigned.</t>

	<t>If o + r is equal to 32, then a full IPv4 address is
	to be assigned. The address is created by concatenating the
	Rule IPv4 prefix and the EA-bits.</t>

	<t>If o + r is > 32, then a shared IPv4 address is to be
	assigned. The number of IPv4 address suffix bits (p) in the EA
	bits is given by 32 - r bits. The PSID bits are used to create
	a port-set. The length of the PSID bit field within EA bits
	is: o - p.</t>

	<t>The length of r MAY be 32, with no part of the IPv4 address
	embedded in the EA bits. This results in a mapping with no
	dependence between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address. In
	addition the length of o MAY be zero (no EA bits embedded in
	the End-User IPv6 prefix), meaning that also the PSID is
	provisioned.</t>

	<t>In the following examples, only the suffix (last 8 bits) of
	the IPv4 address is embedded in the EA bits (r = 24), while
	the IPv4 prefix (first 24 bits) is given in the BMR Rule IPv4
	prefix.</t>

	across all CEs within a MAP domain. The values may be
	configured in a variety of manners, including provisioning
	methods such as the Broadband Forum's "TR-69" Residential
	Gateway management interface, an XML-based object retrieved
	after IPv6 connectivity is established, or manual
	configuration by an administrator. This document describes how
	to configure the necessary parameters via a single DHCPv6
	option. A CE that allows IPv6 configuration by DHCP SHOULD
	implement this option. Other configuration and management
	methods may use the format described by this option for
	consistency and convenience of implementation on CEs that
	support multiple configuration methods.</t>

	<t>The only remaining provisioning information the CE requires
	in order to calculate the MAP IPv4 address and enable IPv4
	connectivity is the IPv6 prefix for the CE. The End-user IPv6
	prefix is configured as part of obtaining IPv6 Internet access.</t>

	<t>A single MAP CE MAY be connected to more than one MAP
	domain, just as any router may have more than one IPv4-enabled
	service provider facing interface and more than one set of
	associated addresses assigned by DHCP. Each domain a given CE
	operates within would require its own set of MAP configuration
	elements and would generate its own IPv4 address.</t>

        <t>The MAP DHCP option is specified in <xref
        target="I-D.mdt-softwire-map-dhcp-option"></xref>.</t>

      <section title="MAP BR">
	<t>The MAP BR MUST be configured with the same MAP elements as
	the MAP CEs operating within the same domain.</t>

	<t>For increased reliability and load balancing, the BR IPv6
	address may be an anycast address shared across a given MAP
	domain.  As MAP is stateless, any BR may be used at any time.
	If the BR IPv6 address is anycast the relay MUST use this
	anycast IPv6 address as the source address in packets relayed
	to CEs.</t>

	<t>Since MAP uses provider address space, no specific routes
	need to be advertised externally for MAP to operate, neither
	in IPv6 nor IPv4 BGP. However, if anycast is used for the MAP
	IPv6 relays, the anycast addresses must be advertised in the
	service provider's IGP.</t>

    <section title="Forwarding Considerations">
      <t>Figure 1 depicts the overall MAP architecture with IPv4 users
      (N and M) networks connected to a routed IPv6 network.</t>

      <t>MAP supports two forwarding modes. Translation mode as
      specified in <xref target="RFC6145"/> and Encapsulation mode as
      specified in <xref target="RFC2473"/>.</t>

      <t>A MAP CE forwarding IPv4 packets from the LAN SHOULD perform
      NAT44 functions first and create appropriate NAT44 bindings. The
      resulting IPv4 packets MUST contain the source IPv4 address and
      source transport number defined by MAP. The resulting IPv4
      packet is forwarded to the CE's MAP forwarding function. The
      IPv6 source and destination addresses MUST then be derived as
      per Section 5 of this draft.</t>

      <t>A MAP CE receiving an IPv6 packet to its MAP IPv6 address are
      forwarded to the CE's MAP function. All other IPv6 traffic is
      forwarded as per the CE's IPv6 routing rules. 
      In other cases, the MAP-T function MUST derive the IPv4 source
      and destination addresses as per Section 6 of this draft and
      MUST replace the IPv6 header with an IPv4 header in accordance
      with <xref target="RFC6145"></xref>. The resulting IPv4 packet
      is then forwarded to the CE&rsquo;s NAT44 function where the
      destination port number MUST be checked against the stateful
      port mapping session table and the destination port number MUST
      be mapped to its original value.</t>

      <section title="Receiving rules">
	<t>The CE SHOULD check that MAP received packets'
	transport-layer destination port number is in the range
	configured by MAP for the CE and the CE SHOULD drop any non
	conforming packet and respond with an ICMPv6 "Address
	Unreachable" (Type 1, Code 3).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="MAP BR">
	<section title="IPv6 to IPv4">
	  <t>A MAP BR receiving IPv6 packets selects a best matching
	  MAP domain rule based on a longest address match of the
	  packets' source address against the BR's configured MAP BMR
	  prefix(es), as well as a match of the packet destination
	  address against the configured BR prefixes or FMR
	  prefix(es). The selected MAP rule allows the BR to determine
	  the EA-bits from the source IPv6 address. The BR MUST
	  perform a validation of the consistency of the source IPv6
	  address and source port number for the packet using BMR.  If
	  the packets source port number is found to be outside the
	  range allowed for this CE and the BMR, the BR MUST drop the
	  packet and respond with an ICMPv6 "Destination Unreachable,
	  Source address failed ingress/egress policy" (Type 1, Code
	  5).</t>

	  <t>For packets that are to be forwarded outside of a MAP
	  domain, the BR MUST derive the source and destination IPv4
	  addresses as per Section 7 of this draft and translate the
	  IPv6 to IPv4 headers following <xref
	  target="RFC6145"></xref>. The resulting IPv4 packets are
	  then passed to regular IPv4 forwarding.</t>
	</section>

	<section title="IPv4 to IPv6">
	  <t>A MAP BR receiving IPv4 packets uses a longest match IPv4
	  lookup to select the target MAP domain and rule. The BR MUST
	  then derive the IPv6 source and destination addresses from
	  the IPv4 source and destination address and port as per
	  Section 7 of this draft. Following this, the BR MUST
	  translate the IPv4 to IPv6 headers following <xref
	  target="RFC6145"></xref>. The resulting IPv6 packets are
	  then passed to regular IPv6 forwarding.</t>

	  <t>Note that the operation of a BR when forwarding to MAP
	  domains that do not utilize IPv4 address sharing, is the
	  same as stateless IPv4/IPv6 translation.</t>

    <section title="ICMP">
      <t>ICMP message should be supported in MAP-E domain. Hence, the
      NAT44 in MAP-E CE must implement the behavior for ICMP message
      conforming to the best current practice documented in
      <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>.</t>

      <t> If a MAP-E CE receives an ICMP message having ICMP
      identifier field in ICMP header, NAT44 in the MAP CE must
      rewrite this field to a specific value assigned from the
      port-set. BR and other CEs must handle this field similar to the
      port number in the TCP/UDP header upon receiving the ICMP
      message with ICMP identifier field.</t>

      <t>If a MAP node receives an ICMP error message without the ICMP
      identifier field for some errors that is detected inside a IPv6
      tunnel, a MAP BR and CE should replay the ICMP error message to
      the original source. This behavior should be implemented
      conforming to the section 8 of <xref
      target="RFC2473"></xref>. The MAP-E BR and CE obtain the
      original IPv6 tunnel packet storing in ICMP payload and then
      decapsulate IPv4 packet. Finally the MAP-E BR and CE generate a
      new ICMP error message from the decapsulated IPv4 packet and
      then forward it.</t>

      <section title="Translating ICMP/ICMPv6 Headers">
        <t>MAP-T CEs and BRs MUST follow ICMP/ICMPv6 translation as per <xref
        target="RFC6145"></xref>, with the following extension to cover the
        address sharing/port-range feature.</t>

        <t>Unlike TCP and UDP, which each provide two port fields to represent
        both source and destination, the ICMP/ICMPv6 Query message header has
        only one ID field <xref target="RFC0792"></xref>, <xref
        target="RFC4443"></xref>. Thus, if the ICMP Query message is
        originated from an IPv4 host behind a MAP-T CE, the ICMP ID field
        SHOULD be used to exclusively identify that IPv4 host. This means that
        the MAP-T CE SHOULD rewrite the ID field to a port-set value obtained
        via the BMR during the IPv4 to IPv6 ICMPv6 translation operation. A BR
        can translate the resulting ICMPv6 packets back to ICMP preserving the
        ID field on its way to an IPv4 destination. In the return path, when
        MAP-T BR receives an ICMP packet containing an ID field which is bound
        for a shared address in the MAP-T domain, the MAP-T BR SHOULD use the
        ID value as a substitute for the destination port in determining the
        IPv6 destination address according to Section 5.1. In all other cases,
        the MAP-T BR MUST derive the destination IPv6 address by simply
        mapping the destination IPv4 address without additional port info.</t>



      <t>If a MAP-E BR receives an ICMP error message on its IPv4 interface,
      the MAP-E BR should replay the ICMP message to an appropriate MAP-E
      CE. If IPv4 address is not shared, the MAP-E BR generates a CE IPv6
      address from the IPv4 destination address in the ICMP error message
      and encapsulates the ICMP message in IPv6. If IPv4 address is shared,
      the MAP-E BR derives an original IPv4 packet from the ICMP payload and
      generates a CE IPv6 address from the source address and the source
      port in the original IPv4 packet. If the MAP-E BR can generate the CE
      IPv6 address, the MAP-E BR encapsulates the ICMP error message in IPv6
      and then forward it to its IPv6 interface.</t>

   <section title="Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery">

     <t>Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header,
     handling the maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of
     any system connecting the two address families. There are three
     mechanisms to handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD),
     fragmentation, and transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP
     Maximum Segment Size (MSS) option <xref
     target="RFC0897"></xref>. MAP uses all three mechanisms to deal
     with different cases.</t>

     <section title="Fragmentation in the MAP domain">
       <t>Encapsulating or translating an IPv4 packet to carry it
       across the MAP domain will increase its size (40 bytes and 20
       bytes respectively). It is strongly recommended that the MTU in
       the MAP domain is well managed and that the IPv6 MTU on the CE
       WAN side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs
       within the boundary of the MAP domain.</t>

       <t>Fragmentation on MAP domain entry is described for
       encapsulation in section 7.2 of <xref target="RFC2473"/> and in
       section 4 and 5 of of <xref target="RFC6145"/> for translation
       mode.</t>

       <t>The use of an anycast source address could lead to any ICMP
       error message generated on the path being sent to a different
       BR. Therefore, using dynamic tunnel MTU Section 6.7 of <xref
       target="RFC2473"/> is subject to IPv6 Path MTU blackholes.</t>

       <t>Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could
       send fragmented packets to the same CE at the same time.  If
       the fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the
       same fragment ID, incorrect reassembly might occur.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders">
       <t>Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of
       the MAP domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the
       transport protocol destination port. The transport protocol
       information is only available in the first fragment
       received. As described in section 5.3.3 of <xref
       target="RFC6346"/> a MAP node receiving an IPv4 fragmented
       packet from outside has to reassemble the packet before sending
       the packet onto the MAP link. If the first packet received
       contains the transport protocol information, it is possible to
       optmize this behaviour by using a cache and forwarding the
       fragments unchanged. A description of this algorithm is outside
       the scope of this document.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside">
       <t>If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same
       IPv4 address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host
       outside the domain. Those hosts may use the same IPv4
       fragmentation identifier, resulting in incorrect reassembly of
       the fragments at the destination host. Given that the IPv4
       fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit field, it could be used
       similarly to port ranges. A MAP CE SHOULD rewrite the IPv4
       fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated port
       set.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="NAT44 Considerations">
      <t>The NAT44 implementedf in the MAP CE SHOULD conform with the
      behavior and best current practice documented in <xref
      target="RFC4787"/>, <xref target="RFC5508"/> and <xref
      target="RFC5383"/>. In MAP address sharing mode (determined by
      the MAP domain/rule configuration parameters) the operation of
      the NAT44 MUST be restricted to the available port numbers
      derived via the basic mapping rule.</t>

      </section>
      <section title="Use cases">
	<section title="Hub and spoke with per subscriber rules">
	  <t>Existing IPv4 service can be realized with MAP using a
	  mapping rule per subscriber. By embedding no part of the
	  IPv4 address in the IPv6 prefix, no dependency between the
	  two address families is created. This may be useful in cases
	  where the IPv6 address allocation is sparse, or for other
	  reasons it is difficult to create efficient mapping rules.</t>

	  <t>The operator has to the choice of provisioning a full
	  IPv4 address to the end-user, or a shared IPv4 address by
	  also provisioning the PSID in the DHCPv6 option. A hybrid of
	  this use case is to provision the full IPv4 address in the
	  DHCPv6 option, while embedding the PSID in the IPv6
	  prefix. That will result in one mapping rule per IPv4
	  address, e.g. with a sharing ratio of 64, one rule per 64
	  customers.</t>

	<section title="Communication with IPv6 servers in the MAP-T domain">
	  <t>MAP-T allows communication between both IPv4-only and any

          would not already exist in IPv6.</t>

          <t hangText="Denial-of-service attacks:">In MAP domains

          common with other address sharing approaches such as DS-Lite
          and NAT64/DNS64. The best protection against such attacks is
          to accelerate IPv6 enablement in both clients and servers so
          that, where MAP is supported, it is less and less used.</t>

Example 1.

   Given the MAP domain information and an IPv6 address of an endpoint:

   IPv6 prefix assigned to the end user:  2001:db8:0012:3400::/56

   Basic Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40 (Rule IPv6 prefix),
      192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix), 16 (Rule EA-bits length)}

   Sharing ratio:  256 (16 - (32 - 24) = 8. 2^8 = 256)

   PSID offset:  4

   A MAP node (CE or BR) can via the BMR determine the IPv4 address and
   port-set as shown below:

   EA bits offset:  40

   IPv4 suffix bits (p)  Length of IPv4 address (32) - IPv4 prefix
      length (24) = 8

   IPv4 address  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)

   PSID start:  40 + p = 40 + 8 = 48

   PSID length:  o - p = 16 (56 - 40) - 8 = 8

   PSID:  0x34

   The BMR information allows a MAP CE also to determine (complete)
   its IPv6 address within the indicated IPv6 prefix.


   IPv6 address of MAP-T CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400

  
 Example 2.

   Another example can be made of a hypothetical MAP-T BR, configured
   with the following FMR when receiving a packet with the following
   characteristics:

   IPv4 source address:  1.2.3.4 (0x01020304)

   IPv4 source port:  80

   IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)

   IPv4 destination port:  9030

   Configured Forwarding Mapping Rule:  {2001:db8:0000::/40 (Rule IPv6
      prefix), 192.0.2.0/24 (Rule IPv4 prefix), 16 (Rule EA-bits
      length)}

   MAP-T BR Prefix  2001:db8:ffff::/64

   The above information allows the BR to derive as follows the mapped
   destination IPv6 address for the corresponding MAP-T CE, and also the
   mapped source IPv6 address for the IPv4 source.

   IPv4 suffix bits (p)  32 - 24 = 8 (18 (0x12))

   PSID length:  8

   PSID:  0x34 (9030 (0x2346))

   The resulting IPv6 packet will have the following key fields

   IPv6 source address  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::

   IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:3400

   IPv6 source Port:  80

   IPv6 destination Port:  9030

   
Example 3:

   An IPv4 host behind the MAP-T CE (addressed as per the previous
   examples) corresponding with IPv4 host 1.2.3.4 will have its packets
   converted into IPv6 using the DMR configured on the MAP-T CE as
   follows:

   Default Mapping Rule used by MAP-T CE:  {2001:db8:ffff::/64 (Rule
      IPv6 prefix), 0.0.0.0/0 (Rule IPv4 prefix), null (BR IPv4
      address)}

   IPv4 source address (post NAT44 if present)  192.0.2.18

   IPv4 destination address:  1.2.3.4

   IPv4 source port (post NAT44 if present):  9030

   IPv4 destination port:  80

   IPv6 source address of MAP-T CE:  2001:db8:0012:3400:00c0:0002:1200:
      3400

   IPv6 destination address:  2001:db8:ffff:0:0001:0203:0400::
