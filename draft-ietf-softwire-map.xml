    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism for transporting IPv4 packets
      across an IPv6 network using IP encapsulation, and a generic mechanism
      for mapping between IPv6 addresses and IPv4 addresses and transport
      layer ports.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mapping of IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses has been
      described in numerous mechanisms dating back to 1995 <xref
      target="RFC1933"></xref>.  The Automatic tunneling mechanism
      described in RFC1933 assigned a globally unique IPv6 address to
      a host by combining the host's IPv4 address with a well-known
      IPv6 prefix. Given an IPv6 packet with a destination address
      with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could automatically tunnel
      this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-point address from
      the IPv6 destination address.</t>

      <t>There are numerous variations of this idea, described in 6over4 <xref
      target="RFC2529"></xref>, 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"></xref>, ISATAP
      <xref target="RFC5214"></xref>, and 6rd <xref
      target="RFC5969"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The commonalities of all these IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms are: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Automatically provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an IPv6
          prefix for a site</t>

          <t>Algorithmic or implicit address resolution of tunnel end point
          addresses. Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4 tunnel
          endpoint address can be calculated.</t>

          <t>Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof into an IPv6
          address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In later phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, it is expected
      that IPv6-only networks will be common, while there will still
      be a need for residual IPv4 deployment. This document describes
      a generic mapping of IPv4 to IPv6, and a mechanism for
      encapsulating IPv4 over IPv6.</t>

      <t>Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms referred to above, the residual
      IPv4 over IPv6 mechanism must be capable of:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
          address.</t>

          <t>Algorithmically map between either an IPv4 prefix, an
          IPv4 address or a shared IPv4 address and an IPv6
          address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The mapping scheme described here supports encapsulation of
      IPv4 packets in IPv6 in both mesh and hub-and-spoke topologies,
      including address mappings with full independence between IPv6
      and IPv4 addresses.</t>

      <t>This document describes delivery of IPv4 unicast service across an
      IPv6 infrastructure. IPv4 multicast is not considered further in this
      document.</t>

      <t>The A+P (Address and Port) architecture of sharing an IPv4
      address by distributing the port space is described in <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref>. Specifically section 4 of <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref> covers stateless mapping. The
      corresponding stateful solution DS-lite is described in <xref
      target="RFC6333"></xref>. The motivation for this work is
      described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A companion document defines a DHCPv6 option for provisioning
      of MAP <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp"></xref>. Other
      means of provisioning are possible. Deployment considerations
      are described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-deployment"/>.</t>

      <t>MAP relies on IPv6 and is designed to deliver dual-stack
      service while allowing IPv4 to be phased out within the service
      provider's (SP) network. The phasing out of IPv4 within the SP
      network is independent of whether the end user disables IPv4
      service or not. Further, "greenfield"; IPv6-only networks may
      use MAP in order to deliver IPv4 to sites via the IPv6
      network.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 3: DESCRIPTION                   -->

    <section title="Architecture">
      <t>In accordance with the requirements stated above, the MAP
      mechanism can operate with shared IPv4 addresses, full IPv4
      addresses or IPv4 prefixes. Operation with shared IPv4 addresses
      is described here, and the differences for full IPv4 addresses
      and prefixes are described below.</t>

      <t>The MAP mechanism uses existing standard building blocks.
      The existing NAPT <xref target="RFC2663"/> on the CE is used
      with additional support for restricting transport protocol
      ports, ICMP identifiers and fragment identifiers to the
      configured port-set.  For packets outbound from the private IPv4
      network, the CE NAPT MUST translate transport identifiers (e.g.,
      TCP and UDP port numbers) so that they fall within the CE's
      assigned port-range.</t>

      <t>The NAPT MUST in turn be connected to a MAP-aware forwarding
      function, that does encapsulation / decapsulation of IPv4 packets
      in IPv6.  MAP supports the encapsulation mode specified in <xref
      target="RFC2473"/>.  In addition MAP specifies an algorithm to
      do "address resolution" from an IPv4 address and port to an IPv6
      address.  This algorithmic mapping is specified in <xref
      target="mapping_algorithm"/>.</t>

      <t>The MAP architecture described here restricts the use of the
      shared IPv4 address to only be used as the global address
      (outside) of the NAPT running on the
      CE. A shared IPv4 address MUST NOT be used to identify an
      interface. While it is theoretically possible to make host
      stacks and applications port-aware, it would be a drastic change
      to the IP model <xref target="RFC6250"/>.</t>

      <t>For full IPv4 addresses and IPv4 prefixes, the architecture
      just described applies with two differences.  First, a full IPv4
      address or IPv4 prefix can be used as it is today, e.g., for
      identifying an interface or as a DHCP pool,
      respectively. Secondly, the NAPT is not required to restrict the
      ports used on outgoing packets.</t>

      <t>This architecture is illustrated in <xref target="topology"/>.</t>

      <t>The MAP BR connects one or more MAP domains to external IPv4
      networks.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="mapping_algorithm" title="Mapping Algorithm">
      <t>A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.</t>

      <t>Mapping rules are used differently depending on their
      function. Every MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic
      mapping rule. This is used by the node to configure its IPv4
      address, IPv4 prefix or shared IPv4 address. This same basic
      rule can also be used for forwarding, where an IPv4 destination
      address and optionally a destination port are mapped into an
      IPv6 address. Additional mapping rules are specified to allow
      for multiple different IPv4 sub-nets to exist within the domain
      and optimize forwarding between them.</t>

      <t>Traffic outside of the domain (i.e., when the destination IPv4 address
      does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule IPv4 prefix in
      the Rules database) is forwarded to the BR.</t>

      <t>There are two types of mapping rules: <list style="numbers">

      <t>Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) - mandatory. A CE can be provisioned
      with multiple End-user IPv6 prefixes. There can only be one
      Basic Mapping Rule per End-user IPv6 prefix. However all CE's
      having End-user IPv6 prefixes within (aggregated by) the same
      Rule IPv6 prefix may share the same Basic Mapping Rule. In
      combination with the End-user IPv6 prefix, the Basic Mapping
      Rule is used to derive the IPv4 prefix, address, or shared
      address and the PSID assigned to the CE.</t>

      <t>Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR) - optional, used for
      forwarding. The Basic Mapping Rule may also be a Forwarding
      Mapping Rule. Each Forwarding Mapping Rule will result in an
      entry in the Rules table for the Rule IPv4 prefix. Given a
      destination IPv4 address and port within the MAP domain, a MAP
      node can use the matching FMR to derive the End-user IPv6
      address of the interface through which that IPv4 destination
      address and port combination can be reached. In hub and spoke
      mode there are no FMRs.</t>

      </list></t>

      <t>Both mapping rules share the same parameters:<list style="symbols">
      <t>Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)</t>

      <t>A MAP node finds its BMR by doing a longest match between the
      End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix in the Mapping
      Rules table. The rule is then used for IPv4 prefix, address or
      shared address assignment.</t>

      <t>A MAP IPv6 address is formed from the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix. This
      address MUST be assigned to an interface of the MAP node and is used to
      terminate all MAP traffic being sent or received to the node.</t>

      <t>Port-restricted IPv4 routes are installed in the Rules table
      for all the Forwarding Mapping Rules, and a default route is
      installed to the MAP BR (see <xref
      target="outside-domain"/>).</t>

      <t>Forwarding Mapping Rules are used to allow direct communication
      between MAP CEs, known as mesh mode. In hub and spoke mode,
      there are no forwarding mapping rules, all traffic MUST be forwarded
      directly to the BR.</t>

      <t>While an FMR is optional in the sense that a MAP CE MAY be
      configured with zero or more FMRs depending on the deployment,
      all MAP CEs MUST implement support for both rule types.</t>

      <section title="Port mapping algorithm" anchor="portmap">
        <t>The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules allow
        IPv4 address sharing.</t>

	<t>The simplest way to represent a port range is using a
	notation similar to CIDR <xref target="RFC4632"/>. For example
	the first 256 ports are represented as port prefix 0.0/8. The
	last 256 ports as 255.0/8. In hexadecimal, 0x0000/8 (PSID = 0)
	and 0xFF00/8 (PSID = 0xFF). Using this technique, but wishing
	to avoid allocating the system ports <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports"/> to the user, one would
	have to exclude the use of one or more PSIDs (e.g., PSIDs 0 to
	3 in the example just given).
 	</t>
 	
 	<t>When the PSID is embedded in the End-user IPv6 prefix, then
 	to minimize dependencies between the End-user IPv6 prefix and
 	the assigned port-set, it is desirable to minimize the
 	restrictions of possible PSID values. This is achieved by
 	using an infix representation of the port value. Using such a
 	representation, the well-known ports are excluded by
 	restrictions on the value of the high-order bitfield (A)
 	rather than the PSID.</t>

 	<t>The infix algorithm allocates ports to a given CE as a series of
 	contiguous ranges spaced at regular intervals throughout the
 	complete range of possible port-set values.</t>

        <t>The Rule IPv6 prefix (which is part of the End-user IPv6
        prefix) that is common among all CEs using the same Basic
        Mapping Rule within the MAP domain. The EA bits encode the CE
        specific IPv4 address and port information. The EA bits, which
        are unique for a given Rule IPv6 prefix, can contain a full or
        part of an IPv4 address and, in the shared IPv4 address case,
        a Port-Set Identifier (PSID). An EA-bit length of 0 signifies
        that all relevant MAP IPv4 addressing information is passed
        directly in the BMR, and not derived from the End-user IPv6
        prefix.</t>

        <t>The MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the
        End-user IPv6 prefix with the MAP subnet identifier (if the End-user
        IPv6 prefix is shorter than 64 bits) and the interface identifier as
        specified in <xref target="interface-id"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The MAP subnet identifier is defined to be the first subnet
        (s bits set to zero).</t>

        <list style="empty">
          <t>r = length of the IPv4 prefix given by the BMR;</t>
          <t>o = length of the EA bit field as given by the BMR;</t>
          <t>p = length of the IPv4 suffix contained in the EA bit field.</t>
        </list></t>
        
        <t>The length r MAY be zero, in which case the complete IPv4
        address or prefix is encoded in the EA bits. If only a part of the
        IPv4 address / prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the Rule IPv4 prefix is
        provisioned to the CE by other means (e.g., a DHCPv6 option). To create
        a complete IPv4 address (or prefix), the IPv4 address suffix (p) from
        the EA bits, is concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r bits).</t>

        <t>The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is
        equal to the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length. The length of the EA
        bits field (o) is given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length, and
        can be between 0 and 48. A length of 48 means that the
        complete IPv4 address and port is embedded in the End-user
        IPv6 prefix (a single port is assigned). A length of 0 means
        that no part of the IPv4 address or port is embedded in the
        address. The sum of the Rule IPv6 Prefix length and the Rule
        EA-bits length MUST be less or equal than the End-user IPv6
        prefix length.</t>

        <t>If o + r &lt; 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then an IPv4
        prefix is assigned. This case is shown in <xref target="addressallocation4-fig"/>.</t>

      <section title="MAP CE">
        <t>The MAP elements are set to values that are the same across
        all CEs within a MAP domain. The values may be configured in a
        variety of manners, including provisioning methods such as the
        Broadband Forum's "TR-69" Residential Gateway management
        interface, an XML-based object retrieved after IPv6
        connectivity is established, or manual configuration by an
        administrator. IPv6 DHCP options for MAP configuration is
        defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp"/>. Other

        methods.</t>

	<t>The only remaining provisioning information the CE requires

	<t>The MAP provisioning parameters, and hence the IPv4 service
	itself, are tied to the associated End-user IPv6 prefix
	lifetime; thus, the MAP service is also tied to this in terms

        <t>A single MAP CE MAY be connected to more than one MAP domain, just
        as any router may have more than one IPv4-enabled service provider
        facing interface and more than one set of associated addresses

        its own set of MAP configuration elements and would generate its own
        IPv4 address. Each MAP domain requires a distinct End-user IPv6 prefix.</t>

        MAY be an anycast address shared across a given MAP domain. As MAP is
        stateless, any BR may be used at any time. If the BR IPv6 address is
        anycast the relay MUST use this anycast IPv6 address as the source
        address in packets relayed to CEs.</t>

        <t>Since MAP uses provider address space, no specific routes need to

      <section title="Address Independence">
        <t>The MAP solution supports use and configuration of domains in so
        called 1:1 mode (meaning 1 mapping rule set per CE), which allows
        complete independence between the IPv6 prefix assigned to the CE and
        the IPv4 address and/or port-range it uses. This is achieved in all
        cases when the EA-bit length is set to 0.</t>

        <t>The constraint imposed is that each such MAP domain be
        composed of just 1 MAP CE which has a predetermined IPv6
        prefix, i.e. The BR would be configured with a rule-set per
        CPE, where the FMR would uniquely describe the IPv6 prefix of
        a given CE. Each CE would have a distinct BMR, that would
        fully describe that CE's IPv4 address, and PSID if any.</t>

      source and destination addresses MUST then be derived as per
      <xref target="mapping_algorithm"></xref> of this draft.</t>

      <section title="Receiving Rules">

<!--
      <t>A MAP CE receiving an IPv6 packet to its MAP IPv6 address
      MUST send the packet to the CE MAP function for decapsulation
      and the resulting IPv4 packet MUST then be forwarded to the CE's
      NAT44 function where it is handled according to the NAT's
      translation table.</t>-->

      <t>A MAP CE receiving an IPv6 packet to its MAP IPv6 address
      sends this packet to the CE's MAP function where it is
      decapsulated. The resulting IPv4 packet is then forwarded to
      the CE's NAT44 function where it is handled according to the
      NAT's translation table.</t>

      <t>A MAP BR receiving IPv6 packets selects a best matching MAP
      domain rule (Rule IPv6 prefix) based on a longest address match
      of the packet's IPv6 source address, as well as a match of the
      packet destination address against the configured BR IPv6
      address(es). The selected MAP rule allows the BR to determine
      the EA-bits from the source IPv6 address.</t>

<!--
      <t>In order to prevent spoofing of IPv4 addresses, the MAP node
      MUST validate the embedded IPv4 source address and transport
      layer port of the encapsulating IPv6 packet with the IPv4 source
      address and transport layer port of the encapsulated IPv4 packet
      according to the parameters of the matching mapping rule.  If
      the two source addresses and transport layer ports do not match,
      the packet MUST be silently discarded and a counter incremented
      to indicate that a potential spoofing attack may be underway.
      Additionally, a CE MUST allow forwarding of packets sourced by
      the configured BR IPv6 address.</t>
-->

      <t>To prevent spoofing of IPv4 addresses, any MAP node (CE and
      BR) MUST perform the following validation upon reception of a
      packet. First, the embedded IPv4 address or prefix, as well as
      PSID (if any), are extracted from the source IPv6 address using
      the matching MAP rule. These represent the range of what is
      acceptable as source IPv4 address and port. Secondly, the node
      extracts the source IPv4 address and port from the IPv4 packet
      embedded inside the IPv6 packet. If they are found to be outside
      the acceptable range, the packet MUST be silently discard and a
      counter incremented to indicate that a potential spoofing attack
      may be underway. The source validation checks just described are
      not done for packets whose source IPv6 address is that of the
      BR (BR IPv6 address).</t>


      <t>By default, the CE router MUST drop packets received on the
      MAP virtual interface (i.e., after decapsulation of IPv6) for
      IPv4 destinations not for its own IPv4 shared address, full IPv4
      address or IPv4 prefix.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="ICMP">
      <t>ICMP message should be supported in MAP domain. Hence, the NAT44 in
      MAP CE MUST implement the behavior for ICMP message conforming to the
      best current practice documented in <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If a MAP CE receives an ICMP message having ICMP identifier field in
      ICMP header, NAT44 in the MAP CE MUST rewrite this field to a specific
      value assigned from the port set. BR and other CEs must handle this
      field similar to the port number in the TCP/UDP header upon receiving
      the ICMP message with ICMP identifier field.</t>

      <t>If a MAP node receives an ICMP error message without the ICMP
      identifier field for errors that is detected inside a IPv6 tunnel, a
      node should relay the ICMP error message to the original source. This
      behavior SHOULD be implemented conforming to the section 8 of <xref
      target="RFC2473"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery">
      <t>Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, handling the
      maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
      connecting the two address families. There are three mechanisms to
      handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
      transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
      option <xref target="RFC0897"></xref>. MAP uses all three mechanisms to
      deal with different cases.</t>

      <section title="Fragmentation in the MAP domain">
        <t>Encapsulating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP
        domain will increase its size (typically by 40 bytes). It is
        strongly recommended that the MTU in the MAP domain be well
        managed and that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN side interface be
        set so that no fragmentation occurs within the boundary of the
        MAP domain.</t>

        <t>Fragmentation on MAP domain entry is described in section 7.2 of
        <xref target="RFC2473"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The use of an anycast source address could lead to an ICMP
        error message generated on the path being sent to a different
        BR. Therefore, using dynamic tunnel MTU Section 6.7 of <xref
        target="RFC2473"></xref> is subject to IPv6 Path MTU
        black-holes. A MAP BR using an anycast source address SHOULD
        NOT by default use Path MTU discovery across the MAP
        domain.</t>

        <t>Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could
        send fragmented packets to the same CE at the same time. If
        the fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the
        same fragment ID, incorrect reassembly might occur. See <xref
        target="RFC4459"/> for an analysis of the problem. Section 3.4
        suggests solving the problem by fragmenting the inner
        packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders">
        <t>Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of
        the MAP domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the
        transport protocol destination port. The transport protocol
        information is only available in the first fragment
        received. As described in section 5.3.3 of <xref
        target="RFC6346"></xref> a MAP node receiving an IPv4
        fragmented packet from outside has to reassemble the packet
        before sending the packet onto the MAP link. If the first
        packet received contains the transport protocol information,
        it is possible to optimize this behavior by using a cache and
        forwarding the fragments unchanged. Implementers of MAP should
        be aware that there are a number of well-known attacks against
        IP fragmentation; see <xref target="RFC1858"/> and <xref
        target="RFC3128"/>. Implementers should also be aware of
        additional issues with reassembling packets at high rates,
        as described in <xref target="RFC4963"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside">
        <t>If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same IPv4
        address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host outside the
        domain, those hosts may use the same IPv4 fragmentation identifier,
        resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination
        host. Given that the IPv4 fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit field,
        it can be used similarly to port ranges. A MAP CE MUST rewrite the
        IPv4 fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated port-set.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
    <section title="NAT44 Considerations">
      <t>The NAT44 implemented in the MAP CE SHOULD conform with the
      behavior and best current practice documented in <xref
      target="RFC4787"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>, and
      <xref target="RFC5382"></xref>. In MAP address sharing mode
      (determined by the MAP domain/rule configuration parameters) the
      operation of the NAT44 MUST be restricted to the available port
      numbers derived via the basic mapping rule.</t>

          and IPv6 sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by
          MAP nodes, MAP does not introduce any new opportunity for spoofing
          attacks that would not already exist in IPv6.</t>

          <t hangText="Denial-of-service attacks:">In MAP domains
          where IPv4 addresses are shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram
          reassembly may be necessary introduces an opportunity for
          DOS attacks. This is inherent to address sharing, and is
          common with other address sharing approaches such as DS-Lite
          and NAT64/DNS64. The best protection against such attacks is
          to accelerate IPv6 deployment, so that, where MAP is
          supported, it is less and less used.</t>

          <t hangText="Routing-loop attacks:">This attack may exist in some
          automatic tunneling scenarios are documented in <xref

          connections that are not subject to MAP port range
          restrictions. To minimize this type of attacks when using a
          restricted port-set, the MAP CE's NAT44 filtering behavior
          SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering". Furthermore, the
          MAP CEs SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy <xref

Another example can be made of a MAP BR,
configured with the following FMR when receiving a packet

IPv6 address of MAP BR:              2001:db8:ffff::1

The above information allows the BR to derive as follows
the mapped destination IPv6 address for the corresponding

the IPv4 source address.

   The Basic Mapping Rule information allows a MAP CE also to
   determine (complete) its full IPv6 address by combining the IPv6
   prefix with the MAP interface identifier (that embeds the IPv4
   address and PSID).

   IPv6 address of MAP CE: 2001:db8:0012:3400:0000:c000:0212:0034

   Note that the IPv4 address and PSID is not derived from the IPv6
   prefix assigned to the CE, but provisioned separately using
   e.g., DHCP.

      <section title="A More Detailed Description of the Derivation of the Port Mapping Algorithm">
        <t>This Appendix describes how the port mapping algorithm described in 
        <xref target="portmap"/> was derived. The algorithm is used in domains
        whose rules allow IPv4 address sharing. </t>
        
        <t>The basic requirement for a port mapping algorithm is
        that the port-sets it assigns to different MAP CEs MUST be non-overlapping.
        A number of other requirements guided the choice of the algorithm:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>In keeping with the general MAP algorithm the port-set MUST be derivable
          from a port-set identifier (PSID) that can be embedded in the End-user IPv6 
          prefix.</t>
          
          <t>The mapping MUST be reversible, such that, given the port number,
          the PSID of the port-set to which it belongs can be quickly derived.
          </t>
          
          <t>The algorithm MUST allow a broad range of address sharing ratios.</t>
          
          <t>It SHOULD be possible to exclude subsets of the complete port numbering
          space from assignment. Most operators would exclude the system ports
          (0-1023). A conservative operator might exclude all but the
          transient ports (49152-65535).
          </t>
          
          <t>The effect of port exclusion on the possible values of the End-user
          IPv6 prefix (i.e., due to restrictions on the PSID value) SHOULD be minimized.</t>
          
          <t>For administrative simplicity, the algorithm SHOULD allocate the
          the same or almost the same number of ports to each CE sharing a given
          IPv4 address.
          </t>
        </list>         
        </t>
        
        <t>The two extreme cases that an algorithm satisfying those conditions
        might support are: (1) the port
        numbers are not contiguous for each PSID, but uniformly distributed
        across the allowed port range;
        (2) the port numbers are contiguous
        in a single range for each PSID. The port mapping algorithm proposed
        here is called the Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) and supports
        both these cases.</t>

        <t>For a given IPv4 address sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of contiguous
        ports (M) in a port-set, the GMA is defined as:

        <list style="letters">
            <t>The port numbers (P) corresponding to a given PSID are
            generated by: <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
(1) ... P = (R * M) * i + M * PSID + j
	  ]]></artwork>
             </figure> where i and j are indices and the ranges
             of i, j, and the PSID are discussed in a moment.</t>
              
             <t>For any given port number P, the PSID is calculated as: <figure>
             	<artwork><![CDATA[
 (2) ... PSID = trunc((P modulo (R * M)) / M)
             	]]></artwork>
             </figure> where trunc() is the operation of rounding down to the
             nearest integer.</t>
              
            </list>
          </t>
              
          <t>Formula (1) can be interpreted as follows. First, the available
          port space is divided into blocks of size R * M. Each block is 
          divided into R individual ranges of length M. The index i in
          formula (1) selects a block, PSID selects a range within that
          block, and the index j selects a specific port value within the
          range. On the basis of this interpretation: <list style="symbols">
          
            <t>i ranges from ceil(N / (R * M)) to trunc(65536/(R * M)) - 1, 
            where ceil is the operation of rounding up to the nearest integer
            and N is the number of ports (e.g., 1024) excluded from the lower
            end of the range. That is, any block containing excluded values is
            discarded at the lower end, and if the
            final block has fewer than R * M values it is discarded. This ensures
            that the same number of ports is assigned to every PSID. 
            </t>
            
            <t>PSID ranges from 0 to R - 1;</t>
            
            <t>j ranges from 0 to M - 1.</t>
          </list>
          </t>


        <section title="Bit Representation of the Algorithm">
          <t> If R and M are powers of 2 (R = 2^k, M = 2^m), formula (1) translates
          to a computationally convenient structure for any port number
          represented as a 16-bit binary number. This structure is shown in
          <xref target="bitrepresentation2-fig"/>.</t>

          <t>As shown in the figure, the index value i of formula (1)
          is given by the first
          a = 16 - k - m bits of the port number. The PSID value is given
          by the next k bits, and the index value j is given by the last
          m bits.</t>

          <t>For any port number, the PSID can be obtained by a bit mask
          operation.</t>

          <t>Note that when M and R are powers of 2, 65536 divides evenly
          by R * M. Hence the final block is complete and the upper bound
          on i is exactly 65536/(R * M) - 1. The lower bound on i is still
          the minimum required to ensure that the required set of ports is
          excluded. No port numbers are wasted through discarding of blocks
          at the lower end if block size R * M is a factor of N, the number
          of ports to be excluded.
          </t>
          
          <t>As a final note, the number of blocks into which the range 0-65535
          is being divided in the above representation is given by 2^a.
          Hence the case where a = 0 can be interpreted as one where the 
          complete range has been divided into a single block, and individual
          port-sets are contained in contiguous ranges in that block. We cannot
          throw away the whole block in that case, so port exclusion has to be
          achieved by putting a lower bound equal to ceil(N / M) on the 
          allowed set of PSID values instead.
