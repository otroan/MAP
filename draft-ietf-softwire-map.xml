    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism for transporting IPv4 packets
      across an IPv6 network using IP encapsulation, and a generic mechanism
      for mapping between IPv6 addresses and IPv4 addresses and transport
      layer ports.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 1:  Introduction                  -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Mapping of IPv4 addresses in IPv6 addresses has been described in
      numerous mechanisms dating back to 1996 <xref target="RFC1933"></xref>.
      The Automatic tunneling mechanism described in RFC1933, assigned a
      globally unique IPv6 address to a host by combining the host's IPv4
      address with a well-known IPv6 prefix. Given an IPv6 packet with a
      destination address with an embedded IPv4 address, a node could
      automatically tunnel this packet by extracting the IPv4 tunnel end-point
      address from the IPv6 destination address.</t>

      <t>There are numerous variations of this idea, described in 6over4 <xref
      target="RFC2529"></xref>, 6to4 <xref target="RFC3056"></xref>, ISATAP
      <xref target="RFC5214"></xref>, and 6rd <xref
      target="RFC5969"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The commonalities of all these IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms are: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Automatically provisions an IPv6 address for a host or an IPv6
          prefix for a site</t>

          <t>Algorithmic or implicit address resolution of tunnel end point
          addresses. Given an IPv6 destination address, an IPv4 tunnel
          endpoint address can be calculated.</t>

          <t>Embedding of an IPv4 address or part thereof into an IPv6
          address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In phases of IPv4 to IPv6 migration, IPv6 only networks will be
      common, while there will still be a need for residual IPv4 deployment.
      This document describes a generic mapping of IPv4 to IPv6, and a
      mechanism for encapsulating IPv4 over IPv6.</t>

      <t>Just as the IPv6 over IPv4 mechanisms referred to above, the residual
      IPv4 over IPv6 mechanism must be capable of:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Provisioning an IPv4 prefix, an IPv4 address or a shared IPv4
          address.</t>

          <t>Algorithmically map between an IPv4 prefix, IPv4 address or a
          shared IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The mapping scheme described here supports encapsulation of IPv4
      packets in IPv6 in both mesh and hub and spoke topologies, including
      address mappings with full independence between IPv6 and IPv4
      addresses.</t>

      <t>This document describes delivery of IPv4 unicast service across an
      IPv6 infrastructure. IPv4 multicast is not considered further in this
      document.</t>

      <t>The A+P (Address and Port) architecture of sharing an IPv4 address by
      distributing the port space is described in <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref>. Specifically section 4 of <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref> covers stateless mapping. The corresponding
      stateful solution DS-lite is described in <xref
      target="RFC6333"></xref>. The motivation for the work is described in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-stateless-4v6-motivation"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A companion document defines a DHCPv6 option for provisioning of MAP
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp"></xref>. Other means of
      provisioning is possible. Deployment considerations are described in
      [I-D.mdt-softwire-map-deployment].</t>

      <t>MAP relies on IPv6 and is designed to deliver production-quality
      dual-stack service while allowing IPv4 to be phased out within the SP
      network. The phasing out of IPv4 within the SP network is independent of
      whether the end user disables IPv4 service or not. Further,
      "Greenfield"; IPv6-only networks may use MAP in order to deliver IPv4 to
      sites via the IPv6 network.</t>

    <!--  SECTION 3: DESCRIPTION                   -->

    <section title="Architecture">
      <t>In accordance with the requirements stated above, the MAP
      mechanism can operate with shared IPv4 addresses, full IPv4
      addresses or IPv4 prefixes. Operation with shared IPv4 addresses
      is described here, and the differences for full IPv4 addresses
      and prefixes are described below.</t>

      <t>The MAP mechanism uses existing standard building blocks.
      The existing NAPT on the CE is used with additional support for
      restricting transport protocol ports, ICMP identifiers and
      fragment identifiers to the configured port set.  For packets
      outbound from the private IPv4 network, the CE NAPT MUST
      translate transport identifiers (e.g.  TCP and UDP port numbers)
      so that they fall within the CE's assigned port-range.</t>

      <t>The NAPT MUST in turn be connected to a MAP aware forwarding
      function, that does encapsulation/ decapsulation of IPv4 packets
      in IPv6.  MAP supports the encapsulation mode specified in <xref
      target="RFC2473"/>.  In addition MAP specifies an algorithm to
      do "address resolution" from an IPv4 address and port to an IPv6
      address.  This algorithmic mapping is specified in <xref
      target="mapping_algorithm"/>.</t>

      <t>The MAP architecture described here, restricts the use of the
      shared IPv4 address to only be used as the global address
      (outside) of the NAPT <xref target="RFC2663"/> running on the
      CE. A shared IPv4 address MUST NOT be used to identify an
      interface. While it is theoretically possible to make host
      stacks and applications port-aware, that is considered too
      drastic a change to the IP model <xref target="RFC6250"/>.</t>

      <t>For full IPv4 addresses and IPv4 prefixes, the architecture
      just described applies with two differences.  First, a full IPv4
      address or IPv4 prefix can be used as it is today, e.g., for
      identifying an interface or as a DHCP pool,
      respectively. Secondly, the NAPT is not required to restrict the
      ports used on outgoing packets.</t>

      <t>This architecture is illustrated in <xref target="topology"/>.</t>

      <t>The MAP BR is responsible for connecting external IPv4 networks to
      the IPv4 nodes in one or more MAP domains.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="mapping_algorithm" title="Mapping Algorithm">
      <t>A MAP node is provisioned with one or more mapping rules.</t>

      <t>Mapping rules are used differently depending on their function. Every
      MAP node must be provisioned with a Basic mapping rule. This is used by
      the node to configure its IPv4 address, IPv4 prefix or shared IPv4
      address. This same basic rule can also be used for forwarding, where an
      IPv4 destination address and optionally a destination port is mapped
      into an IPv6 address. Additional mapping rules are specified to allow
      for multiple different IPv4 sub-nets to exist within the domain and
      optimize forwarding between them.</t>

      <t>Traffic outside of the domain (i.e. When the destination IPv4 address
      does not match (using longest matching prefix) any Rule IPv4 prefix in
      the Rules database) is forwarded to the BR.</t>

      <t>There are two types of mapping rules: <list style="numbers">

      <t>Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) - mandatory.  There can only be one
      Basic Mapping Rule per End-user IPv6 prefix.  In combination
      with the End-user IPv6 prefix, the Basic Mapping Rule is used
      to derive the IPv4 prefix, address, or shared address and
      the PSID assigned to the CE. More than one MAP CE can be
      assigned the same BMR, thus reducing the number of rules
      that need to be provisioned in a MAP domain.
      </t>

      <t>Forwarding Mapping Rule (FMR) - optional, used for
      forwarding. The Basic Mapping Rule is also a Forwarding Mapping
      Rule. Each Forwarding Mapping Rule will result in an entry in
      the Rules table for the Rule IPv4 prefix. Given a destination
      IPv4 address and port within the MAP domain, a MAP node can use
      the matching FMR to derive the End-user IPv6 address of the
      interface through which that IPv4 destination address and port
      combination can be reached.</t>

      </list></t>

      <t>Both mapping rules share the same parameters:<list style="symbols">
      <t>Rule IPv6 prefix (including prefix length)</t>
      <t>Rule IPv4 prefix (including prefix length)</t>
      <t>Rule EA-bits length (in bits)</t>
<!--      <t>Rule Port Parameters (optional)</t>-->
      </list></t>

      <t>A MAP node finds its Basic Mapping Rule by doing a longest match
      between the End-user IPv6 prefix and the Rule IPv6 prefix in the Mapping
      Rules table. The rule is then used for IPv4 prefix, address or shared
      address assignment.</t>

      <t>A MAP IPv6 address is formed from the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix. This
      address MUST be assigned to an interface of the MAP node and is used to
      terminate all MAP traffic being sent or received to the node.</t>

      <t>Port-aware IPv4 entries in the Rules table are installed for
      all the Forwarding Mapping Rules and an IPv4 default route to
      the MAP BR.</t>

      <t>Forwarding rules are used to allow direct communication
      between MAP CEs, known as mesh mode. In hub and spoke mode,
      there are no forwarding rules, all traffic MUST be forwarded
      directly to the BR.</t>

      <section title="Port mapping algorithm">
        <t>The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules allow
        IPv4 address sharing.</t>

	<t>The simplest way to represent a port range is using a
	notation similar to CIDR <xref target="RFC4632"/>. For example
	the first 256 ports are represented as port prefix
	0.0/8. The last 256 ports as 255.0/8. In hexadecimal, 0x0000/8 (PSID = 0)
	and 0xFF00/8 (PSID = 0xFF). Using this technique, but wishing
        to avoid allocating the system ports <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports"/> to the user, one would have to exclude
        the use of one or more PSIDs (e.g., PSIDs 0 to 3 in the example
        just given).
	</t>

	<t>As will be seen shortly, the PSID forms a portion of the
	End-user IPv6 prefix. To minimise dependencies between the 
	End-user IPv6 prefix and the assigned port set, it is desirable
	to minimize the restrictions on the possible PSID values. This
	is achieved by using an infix representation of the port value.
	Using such a representation, the well known ports are
	excluded by restrictions on the value of the first bit field (A)
	rather than the PSID.</t>

	<t>The infix algorithm allocates ports to a given CE as a series of
	contiguous ranges spaced at regular intervals throughout the
	complete range of possible port set values.</t>

        <t>The Rule IPv6 prefix is the part of the End-user IPv6 prefix that
        is common among all CEs using the same Basic Mapping Rule within the
        MAP domain. The EA bits encode the CE specific IPv4 address and port
        information. The EA bits, which are unique for a given Rule IPv6
        prefix, can contain a full or part of an IPv4 address and, in the
        shared IPv4 address case, a Port-Set Identifier (PSID). An EA-bit
        length of 0 signifies that all relevant MAP IPv4 addressing
        information is passed directly in the BMR rule, and not derived from
        the End-user IPv6 prefix.</t>

        <t>The MAP IPv6 address is created by concatenating the
        End-user IPv6 prefix with the MAP subnet-id (if the End-user
        IPv6 prefix is shorter than 64 bits) and the interface-id as
        specified in <xref target="interface-id"></xref>.</t>

        <t>The MAP subnet ID is defined to be the first subnet (all
        bits set to zero). Unless configured differently, a MAP node
        MUST reserve the first IPv6 prefix in an End-user IPv6 prefix
        for the purpose of MAP.</t>

        <t>The MAP IPv6 is created by combining the End-User IPv6 prefix with
        the all zeros subnet-id and the MAP IPv6 interface identifier.</t>

        <t>The length of r MAY be zero, in which case the complete IPv4
        address or prefix is encoded in the EA bits. If only a part of the
        IPv4 address/prefix is encoded in the EA bits, the Rule IPv4 prefix is
        provisioned to the CE by other means (e.g. a DHCPv6 option). To create
        a complete IPv4 address (or prefix), the IPv4 address suffix (p) from
        the EA bits, are concatenated with the Rule IPv4 prefix (r bits).</t>

        <t>The offset of the EA bits field in the IPv6 address is
        equal to the BMR Rule IPv6 prefix length. The length of the EA
        bits field (o) is given by the BMR Rule EA-bits length, and
        can be between 0 and 48. A length of 48 means that the
        complete IPv4 address and port is embedded in the End-user
        IPv6 prefix (a single port is assigned). A length of 0 means
        that no part of the IPv4 address or port is embedded in the
        address. The sum of the Rule IPv6 Prefix length and the Rule
        EA-bits length MUST be less or equal than the End-user IPv6
        prefix length.</t>

        <t>If o + r &lt; 32 (length of the IPv4 address in bits), then an IPv4
        prefix is assigned.</t>

        <t>If o + r is equal to 32, then a full IPv4 address is to be
        assigned. The address is created by concatenating the Rule IPv4 prefix
        and the EA-bits.</t>

        <t>If o + r is &gt; 32, then a shared IPv4 address is to be assigned.
        The number of IPv4 address suffix bits (p) in the EA bits is given by
        32 - r bits. The PSID bits are used to create a port-set. The length
        of the PSID bit field within EA bits is: o - p.</t>

        <t>The length of r MAY be 32, with no part of the IPv4 address
        embedded in the EA bits. This results in a mapping with no
        dependence between the IPv4 address and the IPv6 address. In
        addition the length of o MAY be zero (no EA bits embedded in
        the End-User IPv6 prefix), meaning that also the PSID is
        provisioned using e.g. the DHCP option.</t>

        variety of manners, including provisioning methods such as the
        Broadband Forum's "TR-69" Residential Gateway management
        interface, an XML-based object retrieved after IPv6
        connectivity is established, or manual configuration by an
        administrator. This document describes how to configure the
        necessary parameters via a single IPv6 DHCP option. A CE that
        allows IPv6 configuration by DHCP SHOULD implement this
        option.  Other configuration and management methods may use

        <t>The constraint imposed is that each such MAP domain be

      <t>For a shared IPv4 address, a MAP CE forwarding IPv4 packets
      from the LAN performs NAT44 functions first and creates
      appropriate NAT44 bindings. The resulting IPv4 packets MUST
      contain the source IPv4 address and source transport identifiers
      defined by MAP. The resulting IPv4 packet is forwarded to the
      CE's MAP forwarding function. The IPv6 source and destination
      addresses MUST then be derived as per <xref

      <t>A MAP CE receiving an IPv6 packet to its MAP IPv6 address sends this
      packet to the CE's MAP function. All other IPv6 traffic is forwarded as
      per the CE's IPv6 routing rules. The resulting IPv4 packet is then
      forwarded to the CE&rsquo;s NAT44 function where the destination port
      number MUST be checked against the stateful port mapping session table

      best current practice documented in <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If a MAP CE receives an ICMP message having ICMP identifier field in
      ICMP header, NAT44 in the MAP CE must rewrite this field to a specific
      value assigned from the port-set. BR and other CEs must handle this
      field similar to the port number in the TCP/UDP header upon receiving
      the ICMP message with ICMP identifier field.</t>

      <t>If a MAP node receives an ICMP error message without the ICMP
      identifier field for errors that is detected inside a IPv6 tunnel, a
      node should relay the ICMP error message to the original source. This
      behavior should be implemented conforming to the section 8 of <xref
      target="RFC2473"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery">
      <t>Due to the different sizes of the IPv4 and IPv6 header, handling the
      maximum packet size is relevant for the operation of any system
      connecting the two address families. There are three mechanisms to
      handle this issue: Path MTU discovery (PMTUD), fragmentation, and
      transport-layer negotiation such as the TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
      option <xref target="RFC0897"></xref>. MAP uses all three mechanisms to
      deal with different cases.</t>

      <section title="Fragmentation in the MAP domain">
        <t>Encapsulating an IPv4 packet to carry it across the MAP domain will
        increase its size (40 bytes). It is strongly recommended that the MTU
        in the MAP domain is well managed and that the IPv6 MTU on the CE WAN
        side interface is set so that no fragmentation occurs within the
        boundary of the MAP domain.</t>

        <t>Fragmentation on MAP domain entry is described in section 7.2 of
        <xref target="RFC2473"></xref></t>

        <t>The use of an anycast source address could lead to any ICMP
        error message generated on the path being sent to a different
        BR. Therefore, using dynamic tunnel MTU Section 6.7 of <xref
        target="RFC2473"></xref> is subject to IPv6 Path MTU
        black-holes. A MAP BR SHOULD NOT by default use Path MTU
        discovery across the MAP domain.</t>

        <t>Multiple BRs using the same anycast source address could
        send fragmented packets to the same CE at the same time. If
        the fragmented packets from different BRs happen to use the
        same fragment ID, incorrect reassembly might occur. See <xref
        target="RFC4459"/> for an analysis of the problem. Section 3.4
        suggests solving the problem by fragmenting the inner
        packet.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Receiving IPv4 Fragments on the MAP domain borders">
        <t>Forwarding of an IPv4 packet received from the outside of the MAP
        domain requires the IPv4 destination address and the transport
        protocol destination port. The transport protocol information is only
        available in the first fragment received. As described in section
        5.3.3 of <xref target="RFC6346"></xref> a MAP node receiving an IPv4
        fragmented packet from outside has to reassemble the packet before
        sending the packet onto the MAP link. If the first packet received
        contains the transport protocol information, it is possible to
        optimize this behavior by using a cache and forwarding the fragments
        unchanged. A description of this algorithm is outside the scope of
        this document.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sending IPv4 fragments to the outside">
        <t>If two IPv4 host behind two different MAP CE's with the same IPv4
        address sends fragments to an IPv4 destination host outside the
        domain. Those hosts may use the same IPv4 fragmentation identifier,
        resulting in incorrect reassembly of the fragments at the destination
        host. Given that the IPv4 fragmentation identifier is a 16 bit field,
        it could be used similarly to port ranges. A MAP CE SHOULD rewrite the
        IPv4 fragmentation identifier to be within its allocated port set.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="NAT44 Considerations">
      <t>The NAT44 implemented in the MAP CE SHOULD conform with the
      behavior and best current practice documented in <xref
      target="RFC4787"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5508"></xref>, and
      <xref target="RFC5382"></xref>. In MAP address sharing mode
      (determined by the MAP domain/rule configuration parameters) the
      operation of the NAT44 MUST be restricted to the available port
      numbers derived via the basic mapping rule.</t>

          <t hangText="Spoofing attacks:">With consistency checks between IPv4
          and IPv6 sources that are performed on IPv4/IPv6 packets received by
          MAP nodes, MAP does not introduce any new opportunity for spoofing
          attacks that would not already exist in IPv6.</t>

          <t hangText="Denial-of-service attacks:">In MAP domains
          where IPv4 addresses are shared, the fact that IPv4 datagram
          reassembly may be necessary introduces an opportunity for
          DOS attacks. This is inherent to address sharing, and is
          common with other address sharing approaches such as DS-Lite
          and NAT64/DNS64. The best protection against such attacks is
          to accelerate IPv6 deployment, so that, where MAP is
          supported, it is less and less used.</t>

          <t hangText="Routing-loop attacks:">This attack may exist in some
          automatic tunneling scenarios are documented in <xref

          a CE address based on Forwarding Mapping Rule.</t>

          (<xref target="RFC4953"></xref>, <xref target="RFC5961"></xref>,
          <xref target="RFC6056"></xref>. The attacks depend on guessing which
          ports are currently used by target hosts, and using an unrestricted
          port set is preferable, i.e. Using native IPv6 connections that are
          not subject to MAP port range restrictions. To minimize this type of
          attacks when using a restricted port set, the MAP CE's NAT44
          filtering behavior SHOULD be "Address-Dependent Filtering".
          Furthermore, the MAP CEs SHOULD use a DNS transport proxy function
          to handle DNS traffic, and source such traffic from IPv6 interfaces
          not assigned to MAP. Practicalities of these methods are discussed

   Another example can be made of a hypothetical MAP BR,
   configured with the following FMR when receiving a packet
   with the following characteristics:

   IPv4 source port:          80
   IPv4 destination address:  192.0.2.18 (0xc0000212)

   IPv6 address of MAP BR:              2001:db8:ffff::1

   the mapped destination IPv6 address for the corresponding
   MAP CE, and also the mapped source IPv6 address for
   the IPv4 source.

   IPv4 suffix bits (p):  32 - 24 = 8 (18 (0x12))

      <section title="Alternate description of the Port mapping algorithm">
        <t>The port mapping algorithm is used in domains whose rules allow
        IPv4 address sharing. Different Port-Set Identifiers (PSID) MUST have
        non-overlapping port-sets. The two extreme cases are: (1) the port
        numbers are not contiguous for each PSID, but uniformly distributed
        across the port range (0-65535); (2) the port numbers are contiguous
        in a single range for each PSID. The port mapping algorithm proposed
        here is called the Generalized Modulus Algorithm (GMA) and supports
        both these cases.</t>

        <t>For a given sharing ratio (R) and the maximum number of contiguous
        ports (M), the GMA algorithm is defined as:</t>
